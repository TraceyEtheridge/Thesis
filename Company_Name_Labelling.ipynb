       "'Check out the companies making headlines in midday trading: Gilead Sciences — Gilead gained 2.1% after saying its coronavirus treatment candidate drug, remdesivir, was associated with an improvement in clinical recovery and a 62% reduction in the risk of mortality compared with standard of care in a trial. Carnival Corp. — Shares of the cruise line operator jumped 8.2% after the company said it is seeing strong demand for trips in 2021. Carnival also said it can break even on cash flow with capacity running between 30% and 50%. United, American Airlines — Shares of major U.S. airline companies rallied in unison after positive news about a coronavirus treatment raised hopes for a smooth economic reopening. American Airlines and Delta Air Lines rose 4.6% and 4.0%, respectively, while United Airlines jumped 5.5%. Redfin — The real-estate company dropped 8.2% in midday trading after RBC Capital Markets downgraded the stock to sector perform from outperform. The brokerage cited an overly aggressive valuation in downgrading the stock after the stock soared 400% from its mid-March low. \"Valuation has crept up to an extent we see the risk-reward reasonably balanced, given larger macro uncertainties,\" RBC said. Wells Fargo — Shares of Wells Fargo climbed more than 3% after Wall Street analysts grew bullish on the bank. Evercore ISI added the bank to its tactical outperform list and said it sees upside with the dividend cut \"behind\" the company. Meanwhile, Baird upgraded Wells Fargo to outperform from neutral, saying investor sentiment is too negative. Foot Locker — Foot Locker\\'s stock rallied 4.2% in midday trading after an analyst at Susquehanna upgraded the equity to positive from neutral. The brokerage said it\\'s grown more bullish on the stock as younger customers head \"to Foot Locker Inc.\\'s store banners and websites to spend the newfound money in their pockets to a greater degree.\" Beyond Meat — Shares of the alternative meat company dropped 4.3% after Citi initiated the stock with a sell rating. The bank said in a note that competition in the space is getting tougher and that Beyond Meat faces headwinds in the food-service space. Citi gave the stock a price target that was more than 12% below where shares closed on Thursday. — With reporting from CNBC\\'s Yun Li, Jesse Pound and Fred Imbert.'"

In an interview on Matthew McConaughey’s Instagram Story FB, +0.54% , the actor asked Fauci if certain smaller island nations have more successfully beaten back coronavirus because their residents spent more time outdoors. Fauci replied, “It’s conceivable that that’s the case.” Fauci added that outdoors is always better than indoors for sports, restaurants and school classes.

       " said the stop/start and disparate approaches to shutting down in the U.S. has not worked out as well. Fauci also said it’s not a simple choice between public health and economic health. “The quicker you pull together and get it down, the quicker you get back to normal. We’re all in this together. Unless we do this together, we’re not going to get this under control,” he said. “To think that you can ignore the biologic and get the economy back, it’s not going to happen. You have got to do both.” The doctor compared the pandemic to other challenging times in American history. “Our country has been through very, very difficult situations,” he said. “We’ve been through a Depression, we’ve been through a World War. We pulled together through 9/11.” But, Fauci added, if you are not abiding by social distancing and wearing a mask, “You are part of the problem rather than the solution.” Also see: Dr. Fauci tells MarketWatch: I would not get on a plane or eat inside a restaurant COVID-19 has now killed at least 751,910 people worldwide, and the U.S. ranks 10th in the world for deaths per 100,000 people, \n",

       " says. As of Thursday evening, the U.S. still had the world’s highest number of confirmed COVID-19 cases (5,244,238) and deaths (166,971). Worldwide, the virus has infected at least 20,739,537 people. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.28% and S&amp;P 500 SPX, -0.20% ended marginally lower Thursday, while the Nasdaq Composite COMP, +0.27% ended slightly higher as investors awaited progress between the Democrats and Republicans on round two of a fiscal stimulus during the coronavirus pandemic, and progress on a possible vaccine. In the absence of a vaccine, health experts say social distancing and masks are the only alternative as “herd immunity” — where those who are immune protect the most vulnerable in the population — is not feasible for coronavirus. That requires a very high level of population immunity for COVID-19, and for the virus to not mutate. Fauci told McConaughey that aiming for 100% herd immunity, instead of maintaining safety procedures and waiting for a vaccine in early 2021, would have dire consequences. “If everyone contracted it, a lot of people are going to die,” he said. “You’re talking about a substantial portion of the population. The death toll would be enormous and totally unacceptable.” A plethora of companies are currently working on COVID-19 vaccines: \n",
