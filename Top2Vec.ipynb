      " People are being advised to stay at home as the UK deals with the current COVID-19 pandemic. With warnings the coronavirus outbreak could last for many more months, many people are looking for Government support at this difficult time.  Chancellor Rishi Sunak has introduced several measures to provide relief for workers during the coronavirus outbreak. Although some of the financial packages were well-received by the public, many have expressed concerns for freelancers and self-employed people at this time. Unlike people who have an employer, the self-employed may not be entitled to Statutory Sick Pay (SSP) should they become too ill to work.  READ MORE: Job retention scheme: Do you have to pay NI and pension contribution?    Self-employed people are also not entitled to the Government’s new Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, where the Government will pay furloughed employees up to 80 percent of their salary instead of their employer. However, to help freelancers the Chancellor has announced there will be no payments on account due in July this year. This measure will allow self-employed people more time to pay their tax bill. There are also other avenues self-employed people can explore during this time if they need financial support.    Under the Chancellor’s new measures, it is now easier to make a claim for Universal Credit during the coronavirus outbreak. Depending on your circumstances, you may be eligible to receive a number of benefits from Universal Credit. You’ll receive your first payment around five weeks after applying online if your application is successful.  DON'T MISS: Furlough: If you are furloughed can you take on another job?

As a result of the COVID-19 outbreak, the requirements of the Minimum Income Floor will also be temporarily relaxed throughout the pandemic. New claimants will not have to attend a jobcentre to demonstrate they are looking for employment at this time.    If you are not eligible for Statutory Sick Pay, you may be able to make a claim for the new style Employment and Support Allowance (ESA). If you have coronavirus or are advised to stay at home, you are eligible to make a claim. If your claim is successful, the ESA is paid from the first day of sickness, rather than day eight as it was previously stated.

      " Prime Minister Boris Johnson has advised UK citizens to work from home where possible due to the coronavirus outbreak, but what about those who are unable to do this? Many have found themselves out of work, or forced to self-isolate, leaving rent and bills impossible to pay. So, what does coronavirus mean for Universal Credit? Universal Credit is paid monthly to those who need it to help with living costs. If you are on a low income or unable to work, you may be entitled to Universal Credit. In light of the changes to our day-to-day lives due to coronavirus, Citizens Advice has announced it is calling for measures to ensure that vulnerable people and low-income families have enough to live during this time. This includes immediate changes to Universal Credit and sick pay. Check if you can claim Universal Credit HERE.  READ MORE: Coronavirus UK financial measures: What has Rishi Sunak announced?   The government has announced that Statutory Sick Pay (SSP) will be paid from the first day you are off sick if it is related to coronavirus. If you are an employee and earn at least £118 a week (this goes up to £120 from April 2020), you should be able to get £94.25 a week (£95.85 from next month) for up to 28 weeks. This is the basic amount, but some employers will have a more generous scheme - check with your employer, your contact or staff handbook to see where you stand.  During the Budget last Wednesday, it was confirmed that those suffering at the hands of coronavirus will be entitled to SSP. The chancellor said: \"Statutory sick pay will now be available for eligible individuals diagnosed with COVID-19 or those unable to work because they are self-isolating in line with Government advice.” This extended SSP will be available for anyone advised to self-isolate, even if they have no symptoms.

It was confirmed: \"the requirements of the Universal Credit Minimum Income Floor will be temporarily relaxed for those who have COVID-19 or are self isolating according to government advice, ensuring self-employed claimants will receive support.” The Citizens Advice website says: \"If you already get benefits like Tax Credits or Housing Benefit, tell the office paying you that you can't work because you're sick.

      " The COVID-19 outbreak has forced millions of shops and businesses to close as people are told to stay at home to help stop the spread of the virus. Rishi Sunak has introduced a number of economic initiatives in an effort to minimise the significant impact the virus has had on the UK economy and the public’s finances. Whether you are employed by a business or self-employed there are ways to receive a pay package in the ongoing pandemic. Up until Thursday, it was unclear how the self-employed were going to get paid. Speaking at the daily briefing from 10 Downing Street, the Chancellor laid out his plans to help the UK’s freelancers and contractors. BACK BRITAIN'S BRAVE NHS HEROES - CLICK HERE NOW   Mr Sunak said: “The Government will pay self-employed people who have been adversely affected by the coronavirus a taxable grant worth 80 percent of their average monthly profits over the last three years, up to £2,500 a month. “This scheme will be open for at least three months – and I will extend it for longer if necessary. “You’ll be able to claim these grants and continue to do business. “And we’re covering the same amount of income for a self-employed person as we are for furloughed employees, who also receive a grant worth 80 percent.”  He added: “The self-employed are a diverse population, with some people earning significant profits. \"So I’ve taken steps to make this scheme deliverable, and fair. “To make sure that the scheme provides targeted support for those most in need, it will be open to anyone with income up to £50,000. “To make sure only the genuinely self-employed benefit, it will be available to people who make the majority of their income from self-employment. “And to minimise fraud, only those who are already in self-employment, who have a tax return for 2019, will be able to apply.” DON'T MISS: Martin Lewis: Insight on claiming self-employed grantsFurious Piers Morgan offers to pay NHS workers’ parking finesFirefighters heroes join frontline of battle against coronavirus The Chancellor reckons 95 percent of the self-employed will benefit from the scheme. Under his plans, the self-employed people can access the business interruption loans and Universal Credit in full. Mr Sunak deferred self-assessment income tax payments that were due in July until the end of January next year. The Self-employment Income Support Scheme cannot be applied for yet, HMRC says it will contact those eligible for it and invite them to apply online.  Those in employment can claim 80 percent of their wages, up to £2,500 a month, through the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme. The bailout is open to all UK employer who will be able to access financial support to continue paying part of workers’ salaries who would have been laid off as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. In order to claim, employees must be furloughed by their company. An employee furlough is when bosses require their staff to take unpaid leaves of absence. In other words, they'll still technically be employed but won't work or get paid by their firm. Instead, the Government will pay you 80 percent of your wage, and it’s up to your boss if they want to pay you the remaining 20 percent. Your employer will notify you of your change to furlough. Changing the status of employees remains subject to existing employment law and, depending on the employment contract, may be subject to negotiation. Businesses then submit information to HMRC about the workers that have been furloughed and their earnings through a new online portal. The portal is not currently live – so employers will have to wait until then to submit.

      "-----------\n",
      " The government has promised to underwrite 80 percent of private-sector wages of furloughed employees. However, self-employed workers are currently left in the dark, leading to complaints that they have been left behind.  The government help is unprecedented from a peacetime government and is designed to ensure as many people as possible have jobs to return to once the coronavirus pandemic has passed. Self-employed workers are often more vulnerable than employees as they don’t have a larger company backing their job or the same rights and benefits as someone in full-time employment. There are approximately five million freelance workers in the UK, making up 30 percent of the country’s total workforce. The Chancellor Rishi Sunak has pledged to help, announcing a support package, although the full details have not emerged yet.     As it currently stands, the self-employed will be given access to an equivalent of statutory sick pay, and will be given tax deferrals, but are not part of the 80 percent earnings pledge for PAYE worker. He said last week he would “strengthen the safety net for those who work for themselves.” There is fast mounting pressure to do more to support those on zero-hours contracts, gig economy workers and the self-employed.    The Chancellor told MPs this week: “There are genuine practical and principle reasons why it is incredibly complicated to design an analogous scheme to the one that we have for employed workers. “The ability for the government to distinguish between these people, based on tax returns that are over a year and a half out of date, poses some very significant challenges in terms of fairness and affordability.” Mr Sunak has abolished the minimum income floor and is not applied for the first 12 months of self-employment anyway. Minimum Income Floor is calculated by comparing how much you are currently earning with how much you would usually be earning or be expected to earn.    To be eligible for Universal Credit you need to be ‘gainfully self-employed’ by meeting several criteria: If you are regarded as being gainfully self-employed whilst claiming Universal Credit you will not be expected to look for or be available for other work.   Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour party leader, has written to the government calling for extra help for those facing hardship as a result of the coronavirus pandemic — including the 5m self-employed, renters, benefits and sick pay recipients. Sir Ed Davey, acting leader of the Liberal Democrats, warned that people were under “real stress” and were “literally running out of money”.

      " There are five million self employed workers in the UK. The Chancellor Rishi Sunak announced yesterday the goverrnment would support self-employed workers by paying 80% of their average profits, but this won't be available until June. Self-employed workers are often more vulnerable than employees as they don’t have a larger company backing their job or the same rights and benefits as someone in full-time employment.  To be eligible for Universal Credit you need to be ‘gainfully self employed’ by meeting several criteria: If you are regarded as being gainfully self-employed whilst claiming Universal Credit you will not be expected to look, or be available, for other work. This is so self employed people can continue to work on their business despite coronavirus. However, it will be assumed that you are earning the same amount as someone like you who is in paid work.     This will usually be what someone of your age would earn if they worked at the National Minimum Wage for the number of hours that you are expected to work or look for. This is also known as the Minimum Income Floor. If you earn less than the Minimum Income Floor, Universal Credit will not make up the difference. Additional work will be needed to top up any remaining income. If you earn more than the Minimum Income Floor, your Universal Credit payment will be based on your actual earnings. The Minimum Income Floor will not be applied for up to 12 months after you start self-employment.   This initial 12 months is known as a start up period, and during it you won’t need to look or make yourself available for other work. However you must show the DWP that you are taking steps to build your business and increase your earnings when you talk to your work coach.     If you are self-employed and claiming Universal Credit, and are required to stay at home or are ill as a result of coronavirus, the Minimum Income Floor will not be applied for the period of time you are effected. You must report any earnings from self-employment to the Department for Work and Pensions monthly. There are currently no provisions in place for self-employed people without coronavirus who have found themselves unable to work due to lack of need.   Minimum Income Floor is calculated by comparing how much you are currently earning with how much you would usually be earning or be expected to earn.If you have been self employed for less than a year, the minimum income floor does not apply to you. How much you get also depends on whether you have children or are a carer for another person. The government has been criticised for failing to provide more support for self employed workers. On Friday, the chancellor Rishi Sunak outlined plans to pay employees 80% of their salaries, capped at £2,500 per month, in an attempt to avoid mass unemployment. This does not apply to self employed people.  See today's front and back pages, download the newspaper, order back issues and use the historic Daily Express newspaper archive.\n",

      "HONG KONG, Mar 31, 2020 - (ACN Newswire) -  - China Communications Services Corporation Limited (\"China Comservice\" or the \"Company\"), and its subsidiaries (the \"Group\") (HKSE code: 552), today announced its audited annual results for the year ended 31 December 2019. HIGHLIGHTS: - Driven by the businesses related to digital services in the domestic non-telecom operator market, the OPEX business and the industry-oriented smart application businesses in the domestic telecommunications operator market, the Group's overall results maintained steady growth, with business value further manifested - Domestic non-operator market became the largest customer group for the first time, the development quality of such market was enhanced and became increasingly significant to the profit growth of the Group - The Group built up its strength in 5G technologies and capabilities while proactively satisfying 5G network construction demand of the domestic telecommunications operators. New Infrastructure led by 5G infrastructure will also bring the Group with great potential for growth OPERATING PERFORMANCE In 2019, businesses related to digital services in domestic non-telecom operator (the \"domestic non-operator\") market served as the main growth driver of the Company. Meanwhile, OPEX  and intelligentization businesses in the domestic telecommunications operator market also provided sound support for the growth of the Group. Total revenues for the year amounted to RMB117,413 million, representing a year-on-year increase of 10.6%; profit attributable to equity shareholders of the Company was RMB3,049 million, representing a year-on-year increase of 5.1%. Free cash flow  remained healthy and amounted to RMB4,243 million, representing a year-on-year increase of 17.4%. The favourable results of operations and free cash flow provided strong support for the Group's development, and laid a solid foundation for the Group's enterprise transformation and responses to changes in industry development. Dividend The Board has proposed to distribute a final dividend of RMB0.1321 per share for the financial year ended 31 December 2019, representing a dividend payout ratio of 30%. Moreover, in view of the Group's favourable operating results and free cash flow level for the year, the Board has proposed to distribute a special dividend of RMB0.0264 per share for 2019. Taking into consideration of the above factors, the Company's total dividend for 2019 is RMB0.1585 per share, representing a total dividend payout ratio of 36%. Mr. Zhang Zhiyong, Chairman of China Comservice commented: \"In 2019, against the backdrop where overall macro-economy faced downward pressure and domestic telecommunications industry witnessed slowdown in growth, the Group, with concerted efforts and strong determination, pinpointed the new position of 'New Generation Integrated Smart Service Provider', adhered to the overall roadmap of 'value-driven, seeking steady yet progressive growth and high-quality development', focused on opportunities including 'Cyberpower', 'Digital China', 'Smart Society' and 'Network Information Security' and vigorously penetrated into industrial ecosystems, thus achieving favourable development. During the year, the Group's total revenues, profit and free cash flow achieved steady growth, overall efficiency remained robust, and customer and business structures were further optimized, which all enabled the Group's solid progression towards intelligent and digital transformation.\" MARKET DEVELOPMENT In 2019, the Group adhered to the three main development tracks of the domestic non-operator market, the domestic telecommunications operator market and the overseas market, focused on the digitalization and intelligentization demands in society and industries, forged its integrated smart service capabilities and accelerated market development and deployment. As a result, the Group achieved satisfactory results with business and revenue structures continuously optimized and development quality noticeably enhanced. Domestic Non-Operator Market In 2019, with the Group's long-term investment and devotion to the field of smart service, the domestic non-operator market sustained a rapid and healthy development trend in recent years, and customers in the market became the largest customer group  for the first time. The development quality of the domestic non-operator market was enhanced, which became increasingly significant to the profit growth of the Group. In 2019, the Group recorded a revenue of RMB41,727 million in domestic non-operator market, representing a year-on-year increase of 25.2% and accounting for 35.5% of the total revenues, 4.1 percentage points higher than last year. Of that, revenue from the Core Businesses  in the domestic non-operator market reported a year-on-year increase of 29.8%, accounting for 92.4% of the overall revenue of such market. The development quality was further improved and the contribution to the Group's gross profit increased noticeably. By focusing on the intelligentization demand of the government, society and industries, in recent years, the Group has been constructing an industrial ecosystem and penetrating into key industries including electricity, transportation, airport and sport game, as well as increasing investment in research and development to accelerate the development and iteration of smart products. Driven by the development of smart products, the Group's has made remarkable achievements in the development of large-scale projects, including the \"Smart Game\" for the 7th CISM Military World Games which the Group provided comprehensive planning, integrated game management and command platform construction services; the Shanghai Lingang Data Center project which the Group provided \"EPC + Operation and Maintenance\" in the form of full-process BIM (Building Information Modeling) service; the Digital Government Project for Guangdong province in the form of \"Consultation + Software (Smart Government Services) + Integration\". Meanwhile, the Group has also accelerated deployment and looked for breakthroughs in the new fields of Industrial Internet, emergency management and network information security, and for instance, the Group have established the first provincial-level hazardous chemicals monitoring platform in Anhui and the Industrial Internet Big Data Platform in Chongqing. Domestic Telecommunications Operator Market Upon the issuance of 5G licenses by Ministry of Industry and Information Technology of the People's Republic of China (\"MIIT\") in June 2019, the domestic telecommunications operators further accelerated their 5G deployment, of which the construction has yet to come into scale. The Group responded proactively to market changes, and made full use of the \"Dual Growth Drivers+\" (i.e. CAPEX  and OPEX + Smart Applications) development strategy to expand the domestic telecommunications operator market, which realized a revenue of RMB72,420 million, representing a year-on-year increase of 3.9% and accounting for 61.7% of the total revenues. The Group proactively integrated into the domestic telecommunications operator customers' ecosystems to provide customers with high-quality services in the fields of 5G, Internet of Things (\"IoT\"), network security, cloud-network integration and other aspects, thus facilitating their transformation and upgrade. The demand for industrial digitalization and intelligentization from domestic telecommunications operators became a new growth driver from such customer group following the OPEX business. During the year, the revenue from China Telecom of the Group amounted to RMB40,633 million, representing a year-on-year decrease of 1.6% and accounting for 34.6% of the total revenues. The Group proactively supported the network construction of the operators, and the aggregate revenue from operators other than China Telecom reported a year-on-year increase of 11.8%, accounting for 27.1% of the total revenues. Overseas Market In 2019, revenue from the Group's overseas market was RMB3,266 million, representing a year-on-year increase of 3.6% and accounting for 2.8% of the total revenues. The Group's overseas large-scale projects achieved continuous breakthroughs, such as the 4G network construction project in Nepal, the Digital Mali Project, the Ground and Submarine Cables Project in Congo-Brazzaville and the Power Communication Project in Saudi Arabia. In 2019, the Group was awarded the \"Excellent Enterprise\" for the \"Belt and Road\" 2019 Information Technology Industry by China Information Technology Industry Federation. The 4G Project in Nepal, the National Broadband Project in Saudi Arabia and the Optical Cable Backbone Network Project in Tanzania were awarded the Top 100 Outstanding \"Belt and Road\" Cases for the 2019 Information Technology Industry, demonstrating that the business strength and brand awareness of the Group have received wide recognition in the market. BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT In 2019, by focusing on digitalization and intelligentization businesses, the Group increased resources input to extend its integrated smart service capabilities centered on integrated solutions. New development features of the Group emerged with its consultation and planning businesses led the way and drove the development of software services and smart products, as well as the robust growth of digital infrastructure construction business. Meanwhile, the Group vigorously expanded the OPEX business of domestic telecommunications operators and paid close attention to the new business demand arising from the transformation of such customers, thus strengthening its customers' loyalty continuously to ensure the Group's stable fundamentals. Following the business transformation and upgrade of the Group in recent years, its revenue sources became more diversified and its business structure became healthier. Telecommunications Infrastructure (\"TIS\") Services In 2019, the Group's TIS services recorded a revenue of RMB64,689 million, representing a year-on-year increase of 12.8% and accounting for 55.1% of the total revenues. Capturing the domestic construction opportunities from Digital Economy and Smart Society, the Group has penetrated into the domestic non-operator market by adopting the \"Consultant + Staff + Housekeeper\" service model  and provided digital infrastructure construction related services to its customers. During the year, such revenue from the domestic non-operator market was RMB20,910 million, representing a rapid year-on-year increase of 42.8%, and was the largest revenue growth driver of TIS services. During the year, the Group built up its strength in 5G technologies and capabilities while proactively satisfying 5G network construction demand of the domestic telecommunications operators. However, as the investment of the domestic telecommunications operators in 5G network has yet to come into scale, the TIS revenue from the domestic telecommunications operator market experienced a stable year-on-year growth of 2.1%, amounting to RMB41,153 million. Business Process Outsourcing (\"BPO\") Services Revenue from the BPO services amounted to RMB36,637 million, representing a year-on-year increase of 4.4% and accounting for 31.2% of the total revenues. Adhering to the value-driven principle, the Group continued to contain its products distribution business with low gross profit, as a result, revenue from products distribution business for the year reported a year-on-year decrease of 11.5%. Excluding the products distribution business, the Core BPO services  progressed well with a year-on-year revenue increase of 6.9%. The Group continued to penetrate into the OPEX business of the domestic telecommunications operators and facilitated the quality improvement of their networks. Revenue from the network maintenance business for the year reported a year-on-year increase of 7.0%. In 2019, the Group continued to establish comprehensive and integrated capabilities for the property management. Leveraging on the \"Hui Yun\" platform, the Group enhanced synergistic operation and promoted intelligent transformation. Our property management business extended to fields such as high speed rail, airport and achieved favourable development results. Revenue from the general facilities management (property management) business reported a year-on-year increase of 16.9% and maintained a growth rate of over 15% for two consecutive years . The Group established the supply chain digitalized procurement platform, which enhanced the unified storage capabilities and network-wide operation capabilities. However, revenue growth of the supply chain business slowed down and reported a year-on-year increase of 1.7%, mainly because of the subdued growth in marketing agent and after-sale businesses attributable to the marketing strategy adjustment of the domestic telecommunications operators. Applications, Content and Other (\"ACO\") Services Revenue from the ACO services amounted to RMB16,087 million, representing a rapid year-on-year increase of 17.3%, making it the fastest growing segment among the three major businesses. It accounted for 13.7% of the total revenues, which was 0.8 percentage point higher year-on-year. Through capturing the domestic opportunities arising from the digitalization construction by the government and industries, as well as the intelligent transformation of the domestic telecommunications operators, the Group provided smart products, smart services and industrial integrated solutions to customers. Currently, the Group have accelerated the promotion of over 30 smart applications among vertical industrial customers. In 2019, revenue from the Group's system integration, software development and system support businesses reported a year-on-year increase of 23.5% and 14.2% respectively. Revenue from the ACO Major businesses  reported a year-on-year increase of 18.6%, surpassing the growth rate of the national software business revenue  and demonstrating a sound development result of such businesses. INNOVATION AND TRANSFORMATION In 2019, the Group deepened innovation and transformation continuously to ride on the new trend in Digital Economy era. Construction of foundation platforms. The Group continued to promote the construction of \"CCSYUN\" (our cloud service) and \"CCS Open IoT Platform\" to drive transformation. Besides, the Group improved network and information security capabilities by the establishment of platforms including cloud security, cloud-based monitoring and content automated testing to satisfy market demand. Furthermore, the Group launched pilot maintenance platform to plan ahead for the new maintenance areas of the 5G and IoT era. Enhancement of research and development capabilities. By focusing on social and industrial intelligentization demands, the Group increased investment in research and development by way of setting up a dispersed research and development system as well as capitalizing on its ecosystem alliances and research institutions. The Group converged capabilities based on its foundation platforms to accelerate the research and development and the iteration of its products, so as to respond to market demand in a rapid manner and support development through capabilities enabling. Optimization of ecosystem. On one hand, the Group continuously established the middle platforms for capabilities accumulation and capabilities enabling to optimize internal ecosystem and enrich industrial ecosystem, thus bringing in new partners from government, industries and research and development institutions. On the other hand, the Group emphasized the construction of talent ecosystem by ceaselessly enhancing various expert teams and Comservice Craftsmanship systems, with the view to accumulating adequate reserves of diverse talents. PROSPECTS Mr. Zhang Zhiyong, Chairman of China Comservice said: \"In 2019, the Group adhered to the overall roadmap of 'value-driven, seeking steady yet progressive growth and high-quality development' and pinpointed its new position as 'New Generation Integrated Smart Service Provider'. By firmly capturing the changes in the market and adhering to the main development tracks, the Group achieved favourable results and made a solid step towards high-quality development. Currently, the domestic and global economic environments are experiencing profound adjustment, and the COVID-19 epidemic has increased the downward pressure on the domestic and international economies, and put considerable pressure to the Group's operation and development during such period. At the same time, the COVID-19 epidemic has brought changes to the pattern of production, daily life and demand in the society, accelerating the digitalization progress of the society and industries, which has also brought the Group with rare opportunities. From the macro perspective, there is no change to the basic trend that the economy of China is still heading for long-term prosperity; there is no change to the development advantages accumulated since reform and opening up, including the technological base, the size of the market, and the domestic demand potential; there is no change to the regional economic development strategy and the trend of advancement of the 'Belt and Road'. From the perspective of industrial development and technological progress, the further advancement of 'Cyberpower', 'Network Information Security' and commercial use of 5G, as well as the deep integration of emerging technologies such as 5G, IoT, Artificial Intelligence, Blockchain with the real economy, will create booming demand for digitalization from society and industries. During the epidemic, cutting-edge technologies such as 5G have played an important role and fostered great market demand. 'New Infrastructure' including data center and Industrial Internet, which is led by 5G infrastructure, will also be the critical foundation for digital transformation of the society and the construction of modern smart city. It will not only generate important driving force for future economic development, but also bring the Group with great potential for growth. In particular, the 5G infrastructure will give rise to application investment in the upstream and downstream of the industry value chain and various industries, which would facilitate the continuous emergence of new demand, new business forms and new applications, creating further growth potential in the domestic telecommunications operator market and the domestic non-operator market. In the future, the Group will adhere to the overall roadmap and focus on the main development tracks based on its positioning of 'New Generation Integrated Smart Service Provider' to fit into the overall development of China, the society and industries, with a view to further promoting value transformation and forming new development advantages. In the domestic non-operator market, by focusing on opportunities arising from New Infrastructure such as 5G and riding on the accelerating trends of modern smart city upgrade, digital governance and industrial digitalization as the epidemic broke out, the Group will take various measures to continuously expand its business scale in such market and optimize its integrated smart service capabilities, including: speeding up its deployment in key regions such as Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei, Yangtze River Delta, Yangtze River Economic Belt, Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, intensifying its development in key sectors such as government, electricity and transportation as well as making breakthroughs in key fields such as Industrial Internet, emergency management and network information security. In the domestic telecommunications operator market, the Group will uphold the 'Dual Growth Drivers+' development strategy and take advantage of its advanced deployment in aspects including the 5G construction as well as the research and development for applications. The Group will also integrate into customers' ecosystem in light of the changing industrial development. Furthermore, the Group will further develop the 5G network construction and the OPEX business, while capturing the demand for smart applications and assisting customers in transformation. By taking all these efforts, the Group will secure the fundamentals of our operation while making new breakthroughs in development. In overseas market, by grasping the opportunities arising from the advancement of 'Belt and Road' and leveraging on its 'EPC+F+I+O+S'  model, the Group will focus on the overseas demand for network infrastructure and digital services with the promotion of its smart products and services, thus realizing steady growth of overseas revenue. Meanwhile, the Group will strengthen collaboration with domestic telecommunications operators, 'Go Abroad' Chinese enterprises, and local partners to expand overseas market and explore new development potential. At the same time, the Group will allocate more resources to research and development in respect of 5G, Big Data and IoT, as well as improving our dispersed research and development based on our foundation platforms, with a view to enhancing the quality and quantity of smart products and facilitating capabilities enabling for social and industrial development. The Group will enhance its corporate governance by pushing forward the State-owned Enterprise Reform 'Double-hundred Action', develop flexible mechanism that is adaptive to the changing market, talent team, innovative mechanism and symbiotic ecosystem, with a view to promoting value transformation and becoming an integrated smart service provider with cutting-edge technologies and supreme intelligence.\" About China Comservice China Comservice is a New Generation Integrated Smart Service Provider that provides integrated  comprehensive solutions in the informatization and digitalization sector including telecommunications infrastructure services spanning from design, construction to project supervision and management; business process outsourcing services spanning from management of infrastructure for information technologies (network management), general facilities management(property management), supply chain and products distribution; applications, content and other services spanning from system integration, software development and system support to value-added service, etc. The Company's major customers include domestic telecommunications operators (including the three domestic telecommunications operators and China Tower Corporation Limited), domestic non-telecom operator customers including government agencies, industrial customers and small and medium-sized enterprises, as well as overseas customers.

THE DÜRR GROUP The Dürr Group is one of the world's leading mechanical and plant engineering­firms. Business with automotive manufacturers and their suppliers accounts for 53 % of our sales of € 3.92 billion. Other customer segments include the woodworking industry and the mechanical ­engineering sector as well as the chemical and pharmaceutical industries­.

They were transferred to Paint and Final ­Assembly ­Systems as of January 1, 2020. We are facing a challenging environment, which is constantly evolving: politics, markets, customer needs, entire ­industries as well as consumer behavior and our own demands are all changing. We see change as an opportunity. Only those who continue to develop will stay at the top of their field. Together with our employees, we are fully determined to achieve the best for our customers, shareholders, stakeholders­ and our own company. We are driving change. More about our innovative solutions can be found in the new Eco Magazine CHANGE TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS Chairman's letter DEAR READERS, Ralf W. Dieter (58) Next year Dürr celebrates its 125th anniversary. Our long company history has taught us many things - not least the fact that success is always based on the willingness to change. We, along with our markets, are currently undergoing a phase of major changes. Digitalization, electromobility and sustainability are trends with disruptive potential. Our goal is to be involved in shaping these trends and to support our customers in their transformation processes. This is why the title we have chosen for this annual report is \"Driving Change\". Electromobility is a great opportunity for us. Last year our incoming orders in this area rose by 44 % to almost € 400 million, with production technology for electric vehicles accounting for 22 % of our orders from the automotive industry. Our customers include not only incumbent automotive groups but also new manufacturers of battery-powered vehicles. More than 20 of these newcomers ordered production technology from us in 2019. Our market success in the e-mobility segment is based on a broad portfolio, ­ranging from paint and assembly systems and balancing machines for electric drives through to refrigerant filling systems for batteries. We have also positioned ourselves well in the market for battery production technology, for example by offering a unique technology for coating battery electrodes or glueing technology for battery modules. 2 ANNUAL REPORT 2019 TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS Chairman's letter Digital transformation is another area where we are pioneers. Aside from Industry 4.0 solutions for manufacturing execution systems, we are focusing on IIoT-platform-based smart analytics software. Applications for predictive plant maintenance and real-time quality control enable us to offer customers exactly what they need for their factories. Our software development is carried out in agile Digital Factories, a quarter of our innovation budget is being spent on digitalization, and a ranking published by RWTHAachen University sees us at the forefront in the use of artificial intelligence. The ADAMOS IIoT network, in which we play a leading role, is developing into a successful model: Thanks to the ADAMOScooperation, more than 20 participating mechanical engineering firms already support each other in developing apps, benefit from synergies, share knowledge and thus reduce their resource requirements. THE KEY TOPIC OF SUSTAINABILITY IS INCREASINGLY IMPACTING OUR ­CUSTOMERS' INVESTMENT DECISIONS. The key topic of sustainability is increasingly impacting our customers' investment decisions. Many automobile manufacturers are minimizing the ecological footprint of their production processes. They are assessing us based on how we can support them in doing so. This offers us opportunities, since we specifically develop material- and energy-­ efficient products. Over the last ten years, we have managed to lower the energy consumption in our paint shops by around 70 %. The acquisition of Megtec/Universal at the end of 2018 has enabled us to expand our leading position in environmental technology. The motto of \"Driving Change\" also refers to the adaptation of our internal processes and structures to new requirements. Ongoing digital training, empowering our employees and optimizing the site structure are some examples of this. We are implementing measures to safeguard the company's future success, thus boosting our profitability. ANNUAL REPORT 2019 3 TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS Chairman's letter One important project is the package of measures initiated at HOMAGin November 2019. The company, which we acquired in 2014, has a great deal of know-how and potential. The package of measures is designed to save around € 20 million from 2021 and enable HOMAGto achieve an EBITmargin in excess of 9 % by 2023 at the latest. The growth in earnings at Paint and Final Assembly Systems shows that we can put optimizations into practice effectively. Thanks to the FOCUS2.0 optimization program, the division increased its EBITmargin to 5.0 % in 2019, with further improvements in the pipeline. DESPITE CHALLENGING ­CONDITIONS, THE GROUP AS A WHOLE FINISHED­ 2019 WITH A RECORD LEVEL OF INCOMING ORDERS. Despite challenging conditions, the Group as a whole finished 2019 with a record level of incoming orders. Sales also reached a new all-time high, thanks to a disproportionately strong growth in service business. The increase in cash flow shows that our net working capital management is effective. Despite a slight decline in operating EBIT, the operating EBITmargin was 6.7 % and thus higher than expected after the scaled-back guidance announced in July. At 5.0 %, the reported EBITmargin also exceeded the target range - despite high extraordinary expenses (€ 67.2 million), which were largely attributable to the measures at HOMAG. Although earnings after tax, at € 129.8 million, reached the upper end of the target corridor, they were down 20.6 % on 2018 mainly as a result of the extraordinary expenses. We took this into account in our proposed dividend: At € 0.80 per share, this falls below the previous year's level (€ 1.00), while the payout ratio of 43 % is slightly above the previous year's figure (42 %). 4 ANNUAL REPORT 2019 TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS Chairman's letter The first quarter of 2020 has been overshadowed by the corona epidemic. In China, where the economy temporarily came to a halt, we saw a noticeable decline in sales and earnings. Since the beginning of March the crisis has been increasingly spreading to other countries. As a result, the economic risks have risen significantly. As long as the coronavirus does not put too heavy a burden on the global economy, we are targeting order intake and sales of up to € 4,100 million for 2020. In terms of earn- ings, 2020 will be a year of transition. While operating EBITis likely to rise in most divisions, we expect it to decline at HOMAGon the back of lower sales, especially since the focus there is on the concentrated implementation of the optimization measures. We anticipate an operating EBITmargin of between 6.2 and 6.7 % for the Group. Extra­ ordinary expenses are set to drop to around € 40 million and will be incurred for specific structural measures and purchase price allocations. For 2021 we expect a significant improvement in the operating EBITmargin to between 7.0 and 7.5 %, underpinned above all by positive effects of the HOMAGoptimization measures. In the medium term, we are targeting an EBITmargin of at least 8 % at the Dürr Group. In view of the coronavirus spread, we - like many other companies - must adopt a vigilant approach. However, those who know us realize that we tend to be optimistic rather than pessimistic. Whatever happens, with our leading technologies for digital and sustainable production processes, we are well prepared for the transformation in our markets. The good reputation of the Dürr, Schenck and HOMAGbrands is fueled by the expertise and the commitment of more than 16,000 employees. Together with my colleagues on the Board of Management, I would like to say a big thank you to them for everything they achieved in 2019. Our thanks also go to all customers, business partners and share­ holders - we look forward to sharing our future with you! Best wishes Ralf W. Dieter CEO Bietigheim-Bissingen, March 19, 2020 ANNUAL REPORT 2019 5 TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS Board of Management BOARD OF MANAGEMENT of Dürr AG \"FEW COMPANIES COMBINE DIGITAL EXPERTISE AND PRODUCTION KNOWHOW LIKE WE DO. THIS IS WHAT MATTERS.\" Ralf W. Dieter (58) CEO Until July 31, 2020: Interim CFO 6 ANNUAL REPORT 2019 TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS Board of Management \"DIGITAL, SUSTAINABLE, FLEXIBLE: AT DÜRR THE PAINT SHOP OF THE FUTURE HAS ALREADY BECOME REALITY.\" Dr. Jochen Weyrauch (53) Deputy CEO \"WE ARE IMPLEMENTING THE OPTIMIZATION MEASURES AT ­HOMAG ­BASED ON CLEAR ANALYSIS. OUR­ AIM IS TO ACHIEVE AN EBIT MARGIN OF AT LEAST 9%.\" Pekka Paasivaara (58) Member of the Board of Management ANNUAL REPORT 2019 7 TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS Report of the Supervisory Board DEAR SHAREHOLDERS, In 2019 the Dürr Group performed well, given the challenging political and economic climate. Incoming orders and sales each reached new all-time highs, while the operating EBITmargin stood at 6.7 %, which is slightly above the target range that had been adjusted in July 2019. In addition, the Board of Management took measures in some fields to safeguard the company's future success and strengthen its competitiveness in the operating business. The most important example of this is the HOMAGGroup, where measures were initiated to continue the optimization strategy of the past few years. At the same time, the HOMAGGroup is laying the foundation to realize its potential as a world market leader and achieve its EBITmargin target of at least 9 % in the medium term. The Supervisory Board believes that the Dürr Group is well positioned to benefit from key trends in its markets over the coming years. The first trend is that of sustainable production processes. The topics of climate compat­ ibility and environmental protection are widely debated throughout the world and also feature highly on the agenda of Dürr, Schenck and HOMAGcustomers. By offering technologies that reduce the consumption of energy, materials and resources, the Dürr Group is an important partner to its customers on their journey toward CO₂-neutral production and low-consumption processes. Another great opportunity lies in the digitalization of production processes, because the Dürr Group combines two strengths that are particularly important here: firstly, software competence and secondly, domain expertise, i.e. the in-depth knowledge of processes in customers' factories. The third important trend which can give rise to new business opportunities for the Group is electromobility. This has led to new OEMs entering the market and requiring production systems. At the same time, plant modification business will grow, since 8 ANNUAL REPORT 2019 TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS Report of the Supervisory Board Karl-Heinz Streibich Chairman of the Supervisory Board established vehicle producers are gradually changing their production toward electric models. In addition, the Dürr Group is increasingly offering scalable production systems, which can be flexibly expanded to suit customers' requirements. The Supervisory Board provided careful and critical advice to the Board of Management in 2019. All required information on business performance, strategic measures, corporate planning, and activities requiring consent were provided and explained by the Board of Management in a prompt and comprehensive manner. The Supervisory Board adopted its resolutions following thorough reviews and debate, and based on written decision-­ making materials and discussions. The Supervisory Board carefully monitored the Board of Management's conduct of the company's affairs and confirms that the Board of Management always acted lawfully, diligently and economically. The Board of Management used the risk management system effectively in operational, financial and legal matters, while receiving support from the Compliance and Legal departments as well as Controlling and Internal Auditing. ANNUAL REPORT 2019 9 TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS Report of the Supervisory Board The Supervisory Board received regular and comprehensive information on risks and opportunities, and it provided effective support to the Board of Management in further developing the risk control and monitoring system. The Supervisory Board held five regular meetings and one extraordinary meeting in 2019. One member was unable to attend two plenary meetings and two committee meetings; another member was absent from a committee meeting. In my capacity as Chairman of the Supervisory Board, I had regular contact with the Board of Management between the meetings. KEY TOPICS OF THE MEETINGS Market conditions, business performance, financial situation and outlook were key topics of discussion at all Supervisory Board meetings held in 2019. The Supervisory Board received regular information on the development of incoming orders, sales, EBITand EBITmargin, ROCE, cash flow and liquidity, as well as on the largest contracts and on the pipeline of orders due to be awarded by customers. Other recurring topics of meetings were the development of service business and the refinancing of the Dürr Group. At its first meeting held on March 21, 2019, the Supervisory Board reviewed and approved the annual and consolidated financial statements for 2018 as well as the agenda for the annual general meeting. On the recommendation of the Personnel Committee, the Supervisory Board renewed Dr. Jochen Weyrauch's Board of Management contract for another five years (January 1, 2020, to December 31, 2024). In addition, it approved a new investment scheme for Dürr's \"VORaB\" pension plan and gave its consent for establishing a share purchase program for employees. The meeting concluded with a presentation of the current personnel report by Mr. Dieter. At the meeting held on May 10, 2019, prior to the annual general meeting, the Supervisory Board discussed the Group's refinancing planned by the Board of Management. The Chairman of the Audit Committee, Mr. Gerhard Federer, and CFOCarlo Crosetto outlined plans for issuing a Schuldschein loan and a new syndicated loan. The Supervisory Board made its approval of the refinancing plans conditional upon favorable terms being achieved. At the start of the meeting held on July 30, 2019, I informed the Supervisory Board about Mr. Crosetto's decision not to extend his Board of Management contract terminating in February 2020. The Supervisory Board members expressed their regret and thanked Mr. Crosetto for his great commitment to the Dürr Group. During the course of the meeting, the Supervisory Board and the Board of Management had in-depth discussions on the adjusted forecast announced on July 22, 2019, and on the further outlook for the financial year in progress. In addition, the Board of Management provided information on the successful completion of the refinancing, the customer satisfaction levels recorded 10 ANNUAL REPORT 2019 TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS Report of the Supervisory Board for the Group, and the results of the FOCUS2.0 optimization program at Paint and Final Assembly Systems. Afterwards, Mr. Federer reported on the Audit Committee meeting held the previous day. The topics covered in that meeting included the risk report and the Group's compliance report. The committee had also defined the key points for the review of the 2019 annual financial statements. The first topic of the meeting on October 2, 2019, was the replacement of Mr. Crosetto, with the Personnel Committee informing the Supervisory Board about the selection of suitable candidates. In his capacity as Chairman of the Dürr Technology Council, Prof. Dr. Holger Hanselka then reported on the work carried out by this external advisory board of experts. Dr. Weyrauch presented the Dürr Group's range of solutions for the production of electric cars and explained the product strategy in the business field of battery production technology. Finally, the Supervisory Board acknowledged the EMIRaudit on hedging currency risks and dealt with the upcoming review of the non-­ financial consolidated declaration according to Section 315b (1) of the German Commercial Code. Dürr AGsubsequently instructed Ernst & Young GmbH Wirtschaftsprüfungs- gesellschaft to perform a limited assurance engagement on the non-financial consolidated declaration for 2019. The Supervisory Board held an extraordinary meeting on November 6, 2019. This was to discuss a catalog of measures, prepared by the Board of Management, to safeguard the company's future success. Following a discussion, which sparked some controversy, the Supervisory Board took the majority decision to approve the planned measures for the Woodworking Machinery and Systems division (HOMAGGroup), leading to an extra­ ordinary expense of around € 40 million. Prior to this vote, the Supervisory Board had adopted a decision on the general future approach in the case of plant closures and staff cuts. It stipulates that the employees concerned and the works councils have the opportunity to present alternative concepts which must be reviewed by the Board of Manage- ment. During the meeting, the Supervisory Board also agreed to the purchase of the remaining 75 % of shares in Homag China Golden Field Ltd. and of the remaining 18.75 % of shares in Homag Machinery (Shanghai) Co., Ltd. On December 10, 2019, the Supervisory Board appointed Dr. Weyrauch as Deputy CEO. On the recommendation of the Personnel Committee, it appointed Mr. Dietmar Heinrich as a full member of the Board of Management (CFO), effective August 1, 2020, at the latest; it also defined the modalities for Mr. Crosetto's departure. Given these personnel changes, the Supervisory Board adopted new schedules of responsibilities for the Board of Manage- ment, which became and will become effective on January 1, 2020, on March 1, 2020 (after Mr. Crosetto's departure), and on the day of Mr. Heinrich's arrival. During the meeting, the Board of Management also presented the new Group strategy and the strategies of the Dürr Systems, Schenck and HOMAGsub-groups. The Supervisory­ Board approved the budget for 2020 and acknowledged the planning for the period between 2021 and 2023. ANNUAL REPORT 2019 11 TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS Report of the Supervisory Board It also discussed the second risk report and the report on the internal control system. On the subject of corporate governance, the Chairman of the Board of Management and the Chairman of the Supervisory Board signed the new declaration of compliance with the German Corporate Governance Code. The skills profile for the Supervisory Board was also reviewed. WORK OF THE COMMITTEES The Personnel Committee, which is also the Executive Committee, convened five times during 2019. The main focus of the meeting held on March 21 was the reappointment of Dr. Weyrauch. The meetings on July 30, October 2 and November 6 focused on the arrangements for Mr. Crosetto's replacement. At the committee meeting on Decem- ber 10, preparations were made for the appointment of Dr. Weyrauch as Deputy CEOand Mr. Heinrich's appointment as the new CFO. The Audit Committee held five meetings in 2019. It paid close attention to the quarterly, annual and consolidated financial statements as well as to new accounting matters such as the first-time application of IFRS16 (Leases) and the Group's refinancing. Other topics of the meetings included the tax situation in China and the United States, the use of loss carryforwards and the discussion of the Group's risk and compliance reports. The Audit Committee worked intensively to prepare the 2019 non-financial consolidated declaration and recommended at the Supervisory Board's plenary meeting that this should be subject to another limited assurance engagement performed by the auditor. It also prepared the key points proposed to the plenum for the external audit and checked compliance with capital market regulations. The Committee reviewed and confirmed the efficiency of the internal control system, the risk management system and the internal auditing system; it also reviewed the financial reporting process and the compliance management system (CMS). At the Supervisory Board meetings held on March 21, May 10, July 30 and December 10, 2019, the Chairman of the Audit Committee reported to the Supervisory Board on the Committee's work. The Nominating Committee and the Mediation Committee did not have to convene in 2019. AUDIT AND R ATIFICATION OF THE ANNUAL FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Ernst & Young GmbH Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft examined Dürr AG's annual financial statements, Dürr's consolidated financial statements and the combined management report prepared by the Board of Management for the period ended December 31, 2019, and issued unqualified auditors' certificates. The annual financial statements, the consolidated financial statements and the combined management report were submitted to the members of the Supervisory Board in good time. They were discussed in detail 12 ANNUAL REPORT 2019 TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS Report of the Supervisory Board with the Board of Management and reviewed at the Supervisory Board meeting held to approve the financial statements on March 19, 2020. The same applies to the auditors' reports, which were also submitted in due time. The auditors signing the audit certificate participated in that meeting and in the Audit Committee meeting on March 18, 2020. They reported on their audit and were available for further explanations and discussions. Auditor Marco Koch from Ernst & Young GmbH Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft was responsible for carrying out the audit for the third year in succession. At the Supervisory Board meeting held to approve the financial statements, the ­Chairman of the Audit Committee, Mr. Federer, gave his detailed opinion on the audit documents, on the preliminary talks with the auditors, and on the key points of the audit. The latter included the balance-sheet presentation of the new Group financing, the first-time application of IFRS16 (Leases) and the application of the Group's risks/­ opportunities check list in the sales process. On the basis of the documents presented to it and the reports of the Audit Committee and the auditors, the Supervisory Board examined and accepted the annual financial state- ments, the consolidated financial statements and the combined management report, the latter containing the non-financial consolidated declaration. The Supervisory Board's own review found no cause for objection. The Supervisory Board approves the results of the audits of both sets of financial statements, agrees with the Board of Management in its assessment of the situation of the Group and of Dürr AG, and approves the annual financial statements and the consolidated financial statements prepared for the period ended December 31, 2019. The annual financial statements are thereby ratified. In light of the Audit Committee's recommendation and its own review, the Supervisory Board approves the Board of Management's proposal on the use of net retained profit - a dividend of € 0.80 per share is planned for 2019. The Supervisory Board thanks the Board of Management as well as the division heads, employee representatives and all employees for their commitment in 2019. The Super­ visory Board also thanks the shareholders for their trust. Karl-Heinz Streibich Chairman of the Supervisory Board Bietigheim-Bissingen, March 19, 2020 ANNUAL REPORT 2019 13 TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS Capital market CAPITAL MARKET Intensive communications with investors We are committed to objective investor relations activities based on a spirit of mutual trust to provide comprehensive information and to help achieve a fair valuation of our share - also compared with our peer group. Our team takes time for investors and ana- lysts, explains the background and creates transparency. The muted business in woodworking machinery and the global uncertainty afflicting the automotive industry called for detailed discussions with analysts and investors in 2019. Dürr's Board of Management and investor relations team attended 30 capital market conferences and visited investors at 19 road shows in Europe and America. As well as this, we registered strong demand for conference calls and visits by investors to our corporate headquarters in Bietigheim-Bissingen. All told, we held more than 500 discussions in 2019. PRICE/EARNINGS R ATIO IN LINE WITH PEER GROUP AVER AGE Our listed peer group includes mechanical engineering companies and engineering service providers such as Andritz, Bertrandt, Deutz, Edag, Gea, Heidelberger Druckmaschinen, Jungheinrich, Kion, Krones and Rheinmetall. The price/earnings ratio, enterprise value (EV) to EBIT, EBITDAand sales as well as share price to book value constitute the benchmarks for a peer group comparison of our valuation. At the end of 2019, EV/EBITDAwas on a par with the peer group average, while the price/earnings ratio exceeded it. The consistently updated analyst consensus on sales, earnings and dividends can be found at www.durr-group.com under Investors/ Share/Estimates. STRONG YEAR-END R ALLY ON THE MARKETS The DAXindices entered 2019 on an upbeat note, underpinned in particular by the central banks, which additionally eased their monetary policies with the prospect of even lower interest rates in response to weaker macroeconomic indicators. However, the 14 ANNUAL REPORT 2019 TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS Capital market 1.1 -PERFORMANCE OF DÜRR SHARE IN XETRA TRADING, JANUARY DECEMBER 2019 Compared to the DAX, MDAX and SDAX (indexed figures) 140 120 100 80 60 Jan. Feb. Mar. Apr. May Jun. Jul. Aug. Sep. Oct. Nov. Dec. Dürr share DAX MDAX SDAX indices ceded a part of their gains in the further course of the year due to the worsening trade dispute between the United States on the one hand and China and Europe on the other. Signs of an easing of the trade conflicts together with unexpectedly strong corporate earnings increasingly raised spirits on the markets from the autumn. The DAXreached a high for the year of 13,426 points in December, with the MDAXhitting a new all-time high of 28,643 points. The two indices closed 2019 with a performance of 25.3 % and 31.1 %, respectively. The Dürr share (ISIN: DE0005565204) moved in step with the upbeat overall market up until the beginning of April. After a brief rally, it reached a high for the year of € 42.26 on May 3, 2019, after which a negative trend emerged. Investors were expecting protracted restraint in the woodworking machinery market and structural shortcomings at HOMAG, following the announcement of our scaled-back guidance on July 22 and muted figures for the first half of the year. After reaching a low of just under € 21 at the beginning of October, the Dürr share recovered significantly. Driven in particular by the structural efficiency measures announced for the HOMAGGroup, the share closed the year at DIVIDEND OF € 0.80 PER SHARE PROPOSED - PAYOUT R ATIO AT 43 % A dividend of € 0.80 per share is being proposed for 2019, equivalent to a reduction of 20.0 % over the previous year (€ 1.00). With the total distribution coming to € 55.4 million, the payout ratio stands at 43 % of consolidated net profit and thus above our customary range of 30 to 40 %. The higher ratio reflects the fact that earnings came under significant pressure from extraordinary effects in 2019. It also expresses our confidence about our business performance in 2020 despite the more challenging underlying conditions. XETRAaccounts for a good 95 % of trading in Dürr shares. However, the shares traded via XETRAand on the floor constitute only a good 30 % of daily trading. The shares are mostly traded on an over-the- counter basis. Average daily trading volumes of Dürr shares dropped to around 243,000 in 2019 (2018: 288,000). In value terms, daily trading volumes declined from € 11.9 million in the previous year to € 7.3 million due to the lower share price. XETRAtrading volumes across all German shares decreased by 14 % to € 1,217 ­billion in 2019.

The geopolitical risks, reservations about the automotive markets and the unsatisfactory performance of the HOMAGGroup triggered substantial downside revisions in analysts' share target price in the course of the year. However, analysts adopted a more positive assessment following the announcement of structural adjustments at the HOMAGGroup. The average target price for the Dürr share stood at € 31.66 as of December 31, 2019. 89 % of the analysts rated the share a \"buy\" or a \"hold\". 16 ANNUAL REPORT 2019 TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS Capital market 1.4 -ANALYST RECOMMENDATIONS (DECEMBER 31, 2019) 9 Hold Buy 8 FREE FLOAT AT 71 % The Dürr family as the anchor shareholder holds 29.1 % of Dürr AG's stock and plans to retain a quota of over 25 % in the future.

Average daily trading volumes on German trading platforms came to around € 44,000 (2018: € 35,000 on the Stuttgart Stock Exchange). In June, we placed a Schuldschein loan for € 200 million with a coupon tied to the EcoVadis sustainability rating for the Dürr Group. Dürr AGis the world's first company to pursue this form of sustainability-­oriented funding in a Schuldschein loan issue. The average coupon on the heavily oversubscribed loan stands at 0.84 %. The syndicated loan of € 750 million agreed upon in August also includes a sustainability component. We have dispensed with issue and issuer ratings for some years as we see no reasonable justification for the expense of having a rating calculated. The capital market accepts this decision. 18 ANNUAL REPORT 2019 COMBINED1MANAGEMENT­ REPORT PAGE 20-98 COMBINED MANAGEMENT REPORT 21 FUNDAMENTALS 21 The Group at a glance 53 BUSINESS REPORT 53 Economy and industry environment­ 37 SUSTAINABILITY 80 EVENTS SUBSEQUENT TO 38 Materiality analysis THE REPORTING DATE 38 Integrity 40 Employees 43 Environment 81 REPORT ON RISKS, ­ 44 Social commitment OPPORTUNITIES AND EXPECTED 45 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FUTURE DEVELOPMENT 81 Risks 45 Other information on corporate­ governance 90 Opportunities 92 Expected future development 49 2019 compensation report 96 DÜRR AG (GERMAN COMMERCIAL­ CODE) COMBINED MANAGEMENT REPORT We have combined the management report of the Dürr Group with the management report of Dürr AG, in accordance with Section 315 (3) of Germany's Commercial­ Code (HGB) in conjunction with Section 298 (2) HGB. The management report is therefore termed a combined management report. It contains the non-financial ­consolidated declaration within the meaning of Section 315b ff. HGB in association with Section 289b ff. HGB. The content of the non-financial consolidated declaration is marked with a line in the margin and the abbreviation NFD. Unless otherwise specified, the information below is applicable to both the Dürr Group and Dürr AG. Statements which refer exclusively to Dürr AG are correspondingly marked. These come at the end of the combined management report. COMBINED MANAGEMENT REPORT Fundamentals: The Group at a glance FUNDAMENTAL S NFD The Group at a glance PROFILE The Dürr Group is one of the global leaders in mechanical and plant engineering. We are home to outstanding expertise in the digitalization and automation of industrial manufacturing processes. Our machines, plant and services stand for production efficiency and sustainability, whether in the automotive industry, which is responsible for 53%of our sales, or in other sectors such as the woodworking, mechanical engineering, chemical, pharmaceutical and electrical/electronic engineering industries. We run 112sites in 34countries. We operate globally with our Dürr, Schenck and HOMAGbrands. In addition to North America and Western Europe, we are also strongly represented in the emerging markets1. These accounted for 41%of our order intake and 45%of our sales in fiscal 2019. GROUP ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE Dürr AGis the Group's management holding company. It holds - directly or indirectly - the investments in the Group companies and handles central tasks such as financing, controlling and account- ing, as well as legal affairs, taxation, internal auditing, corporate 2.1 -GROUP STRUCTURE communication and human resources management. Together NFD with Dürr Technologies GmbH and Dürr International GmbH, which act as holding companies for equity interests, plus Dürr IT ServiceGmbH, Dürr AGforms the Corporate Center. Within the Dürr Group, there are the three sub-groups, Dürr Systems, Schenck and HOMAG, to which five divisions with their operating businesses are assigned. The divisions form the reportable segments within the meaning of the IFRS: ȖȖPaint and Final Assembly Systems ȖȖApplication Technology ȖȖClean Technology Systems ȖȖMeasuring and Process Systems ȖȖWoodworking Machinery and Systems DIVISIONS, BUSINESS MARKETS, MARKET SHARES2, IMPORTANT PRODUCTS AND SERVICES Paint and Final Assembly Systems Paint and Final Assembly Systems mainly plans, builds and upgrades turnkey paint shops and final assembly lines for the automotive industry. We supply products and processes for all the process stages in paint shop technology. The core products are the RoDip dip-coatingpage 200system, which gives vehicle bodies their anti-corrosion coat, and the energy-efficient Eco­ DryScrubber Management-Holding Dürr AG Sub-groups Dürr Systems Schenck HOMAG Divisions Paint and Final Assembly Application Technology Clean Technology Measuring and Process Woodworking Machinery Systems Systems Systems and Systems 1 Asia (excluding Japan), South and Central America, Africa, Eastern Europe 2 own figures ANNUAL REPORT 2019 21 COMBINED MANAGEMENT REPORT Fundamentals: The Group at a glance and EcoDryX paint booth systems. We usually also supply the relevant control, ovenpage 200and conveyor systems plus air supply and exhaust-air systems. We lead the field over the competition for paint shop business with a global market share of approximately 40%. Our digital product offering is integrated in the DXQsoftware family. It includes, for example, solutions for plant moni- toring, higher-level factory control, advanced analytics and predictive maintenance. In final assembly systems, too, we are one of the few companies worldwide capable of supplying turnkey plants. Electromobility is opening up additional business opportunities in this field. Since electric cars have a less complex power train than conventional cars, a greater degree of automation is possible in their assembly pro- cess. Furthermore, our customers will increasingly be upgrading their assembly plants in the future so that, in addition to vehicles with internal combustion engines, they will also be able to produce hybrid and electric vehicles. We have a market share of 20to 25%in business related to final vehicle assembly lines. Since January 1, 2020, the division has also included the automotive­ business in filling and testing technologypage 200as well as assembly technology and marriage stations. Previously, these activities­ were based in the Measuring and Process Systems ­division. The realignment allows us to provide better ­customer ­service from a single source. The filling technology segment supplies­ ­systems for filling vehicles in the final assembly process, forexample­ with oil or brake fluid. The major products in testing techno­logy include end- of-line test stands and calibration stations for brakes, electronics and chassis geometry. The focus in ­assembly systems is on marriage stations, in which car bodies and power trains are brought together and attached to each other. The Dürr Consulting unit is also part of Paint and Final ­Assembly Systems. It advises customers on planning and optimizing production and logistics processes, particularly in painting and final ­assembly technology. The focus of its consulting activities is currently­ on issues relating to the production of electric cars and batteries. Application Technology Application Technology generates almost85%of its sales with techno­logies for the automated spray application of primers, base coats and clear coats. The key products are the EcoBell3high-speed rotating atomizer page 200, the EcoLCC2color changer and the third generation of our EcoRPpainting robot family. It also offers, for example, the EcoSupply P special paint supply system and other systems used for paint supply, quality assurance, as well as process control and evaluation. We are the leading supplier in the automotive sector with a global market share of around 50%. Our two most important competitors are manufacturers of standard industrial robots. In addition to paint application technologypage 200,we are active in two related business fields, i.e. sealing technologypage 200and glueing technologypage 200.Sealing processes are used for sealing seams, applying underbody protection and injecting insulating materials in cars. Glueing is an alternative to welding vehicle components during body-in-white production and final assembly. One significant benefit is that it permits the use of non-weldablelightweightmaterialspage 200in the manufacture of vehicle bodies. During final assembly, glueing technology is used, for instance, for fitting windows, glass roofs, cockpits and tanks. Application Technology also addresses markets outside the automotive industry. Its Industrial Products business unit, which is responsible for this side of its activities, offers paint application products for sectors such as the plastics, ceramics, shipbuilding, timber and furniture industries. Clean Technology Systems Clean Technology Systems operates mainly in the field of exhaust- air purification technology. Our systems are used in the chemical and pharmaceutical industries, but also in sectors such as print- ing, mining, oil and gas, woodworking and carbon fiber production. Furthermore, the equipping of automotive paint shops accounts for around 15%of sales in exhaust-air purification technology. Our most important process is thermal oxidationpage 200,in which pollutants are incinerated at up to 1,000°C. The port­folio also includes sound insulation systems and coating systems for battery electrodes. Following the successful acquisition and integration of the USenvironmental technology companies Megtec and ­Universal in October 2018, we are now the world's leading supplier, with a market share of almost 25%. Measuring and Process Systems Measuring and Process Systems offers balancing and diagnostic technology as well as solutions for the automated filling of refrig- erators, air-conditioning systems and heat pumps with refrigerants. In 2019, 63%of sales were generated in the automotive sector. We are the world's largest supplier of balancing technologypage 200,with a market share of around 45%. In fiscal 2019, the division still included the filling, testing and assembly technology business for the automotive industry. Since January 1, 2020, this business has been part of the Paint and Final Assembly Systems division. 22 ANNUAL REPORT 2019 COMBINED MANAGEMENT REPORT Fundamentals: The Group at a glance Woodworking Machinery and Systems Woodworking Machinery and Systems consists of the activities of the HOMAGGroup, the world's leading supplier of woodworking­ machinery and systems.

In doing so, we ­primarily rely on the following factors: ȖȖEfficient production and assembly sites for core products We are globally active in niche markets, in which we are the largest­ supplier, with market shares ranging from 25to 50%. 58%of Group sales are attributable to mechanical engineering and 42%to plant engineering. In mechanical engineering, we aim for EBITmargins of 10to 12%; in plant engineering, the target margin is 6to 7%. In terms of return on capital employed (ROCE), our plant engineering­ busi- ness achieves higher figures, in some cases in excess of 100%, since thecapital employed page 201 there is very low. In mechanical­ engineering operations, we aim forROCEof15to25%. Our business model allows us on principle to achieve high operating­ cash flows andfree cash flows page 201. 2.3 -PROCESSES IN PLANT ENGINEERING Financial importance of individual products, services NFD and business markets In view of our broad-based portfolio, the financial importance of individual products and services is limited. A key success factor in the paint shop business and at HOMAGis our systems expertise, i.e. the ability to plan and build turnkey systems. Increasingly, technology for the digital control of systems and machines is also playing an important role. The growing service business generates an above-average contribution to earnings within the Group. Thanks to our international presence, we have a balanced regional sales breakdown. In 2019, 17.1%of revenue accrued in Germany, 27.4%in other European countries, 26.9%in North and South America and 28.7%in Asia, Africa and Australia. The earnings ­contribution from the individual regions is approximately in line with the regional breakdown of sales. In regions of strong growth, we tend to achieve slightly higher margins. Business processes/process advantages Planning, engineering, order execution and service are our most important business processes. We have expanded our in-house production in recent years in the interests of quality, achieving on-time deliveries and protecting our intellectual property. Professional project management is critical to success in large plant ­engineering projects in particular. A large project usually requires 15to 24months for completion, while the figure for machinery orders is between 2and 12months. Smaller remodeling, upgrade and service projects are of shorter duration. Project inquiry Planning phase Order Delivery order Service from customer intake Planning Bid Technical Engineering Manufacture Instal- Commis- Final Spares, analysis lation sioning inspection upgrades etc. ANNUAL REPORT 2019 25 COMBINED MANAGEMENT REPORT Fundamentals: The Group at a glance NFD Large projects require smooth collaboration between various departments and sites. We therefore operate with digitally assisted standard processes in planning, order execution, service and administration. Harmonized ITsystems are of particular importance in this respect. They prevent interface problems, automate processes and enable the international sharing of work packages and effective capacity management. Customer relations Business with car manufacturers and suppliers is technically complex and long-term. We therefore maintain constant communication with them. We act as a planner, consultant and system supplier. In the case of major investment projects, we are involved for up to two years before an order is placed. As a service partner, we support our customers in plant operation and in the event of upgrades. Customers often inform us in advance of the development of new models to ensure that we can supply the required production technology in due time. The mechanical engineering divisions - Measuring and Process Systems and Woodworking Machinery and Systems - have a broad market base with tens of thousands of customers. Sales-related expenses are therefore higher than for plant engineering business with the automotive industry. In addition to supplying individual machines, however, there are also larger projects with extended lead times in the mechanical engineering sector. Supplier relations We source goods, raw materials and services from several thousand suppliers. In addition to parts and component suppliers, we also often use the services of contract manufacturers, engineering consultancies and logistics companies. In the case of crucial commodity groups, we enter into global framework agreements with preferred suppliers. This enables us to pool the demands of several companies and divisions and achieve economies of scale. For further informa- tion, please refer to the\"Procurement\" chapter page 32. Further features of our business model At 37%, our real net output ratio is relatively low, though there are differences between the divisions. While, for example, the Woodworking Machinery and Systems division (mechanical engineering) has a real net output ratio of 46%, in the Paint and Final Assembly Systems division (plant engineering), the real net output ratio is a mere 26%. Because of the low real net output ratio, the asset intensitypage 201and capital employed are also relatively low. The prepayments received from customers generally cover the receivables and inventories in current assets to a significant level. Consequently, thenet working capital (NWC) page 201in plant engineering is NFD usually low or even negative. In relation to the fixed costs, too, we benefit from the low real net output ratio and asset intensity, which makes us more flexible in the event of cyclical order-book fluctuations. We have observed a change in payment behavior­ among our customers from the automotive industry: Payments are more often made with delays and prepayments are lower than in previous­ years. The days working capital at the end of the year was 46.1days, the target corridor being 40to 50days. Measured against sales, our need for capital­ investment (excluding acquisi- tions) is low. This is due in particular to the low demand for tangible­ assets in plant engineering. By applying the accounting standard IFRS 16\"Leases\", we report higher investments. The annual ­normal level is now € 95to 105million (2019: € 102.6million); previously it was € 80to 90million. The HOMAGGroup expects annual invest- ments of approximately € 40million. That is more than in the other divisions­ since the HOMAGGroup's real net output ratio is signifi- cantly higher. Most divisions have local production plants and procurement structures in major foreign markets. This reduces their need to import and thus the transaction risks. Translation effects result- ing from the conversion of foreign currency items into euros are more important. Projects in the automotive industry and with large furniture manu­ facturers often have long lead times. On principle, this allows us a clear picture in terms of the future order book. We can therefore make a rather accurate assessment of our future sales, capacity utilization­ and income situation for a major portion of the business. BUSINESS LOCATIONS AND DIVISION OF L ABOR WITHIN THE GROUP We have 112sites all over the world. At year's end 2019, 32.1%of the workforce were employed in the emerging markets. Shanghai, with almost 2,400employees (including around 320external staff), is the largest location in the emerging markets. Our lead sites in Germany control the Group's global oper- ations. The Dürr Campus in Bietigheim-Bissingen (approx. 2,330employees)­ is the Group's corporate headquarters and also the head office of Paint and Final Assembly Systems, Application Technology and Clean Technology Systems. Darmstadt (around 590­employees) coordinates Measuring and Process Systems' operations. The HOMAGGroup head office in Schopfloch (approx. 1,770employees) manages Woodworking Machinery and Systems' business activities. 26 ANNUAL REPORT 2019 COMBINED MANAGEMENT REPORT Fundamentals: Company-specific leading indicators/Strategy Guidelines define how the Group companies collaborate on cross-border systems projects in plant engineering. In the case of major orders for Paint and Final Assembly Systems, the system­ centers­ in Bietigheim-Bissingen or Shanghai take over project leadership. There are also business centers that are responsible for smaller upgrades, parts of systems projects, and local sales and ­service. In mechanical engineering, the German lead sites act as the hub at the center of international projects. Company-specific leading indicators In managing the company, we follow various leading indicators. This enables us to prepare in good time for economic changes and changes in demand. We use four types of indicators: Strategy The Dürr Group adopted its new mid-term strategy at the beginning of 2020. The strategy is the roadmap for profitable growth and for raising earnings to a top level in the international mechanical and plant engineering sector. The new strategy is linked to medium-­ term targets for four key indicators: In order to achieve our goals and expand our leading position in the world market, we are continuing to push ahead with digitalization as a central strategic element. In addition, we are position­ ing ourselves to optimum effect in four strategic fields: global presence, innovation, efficiency, lifecycle services. We have also defined four enablers, i.e. supporting functions that are particu- larly important­ for the successful implementation of our strategy: ­sustainability, mergers & acquisitions, finance organization and people development.

It enables our customers to achieve greater plant availability, reduce costs and automate the production of individualized­products. Digitalization is relevant for all four strategic fields in the Dürr Group: It exerts a decisive influence on innovation manage­ment and our service offerings. In addition, digital­ ­processes and tools are the key to efficient collaboration and global networking within the Group. Market leader in the digital era To remain ahead of the competition in the digital era, we need to offer our customers the best solutions for the digital optimization of their production. To this end, we are expanding our range of databased software applications, intelligent products, digital services and corresponding business models. In this way, we are ­tapping into new sales potential and shielding our business from ­competitors in the software industry. We have a crucial advantage over them in that we combine digital know-how with expert knowledge of production­ processes - also known as \"shop-floor competence\". digital@DÜRR: specific approaches Our strategy for the digital transformation goes by the name of \"digital@DÜRR\". It defines various approaches for successfully structuring the digital transformation: ANNUAL REPORT 2019 29 COMBINED MANAGEMENT REPORT Fundamentals: Strategy STR ATEGIC FIELD: GLOBAL PRESENCE Our business is international and we have a global footprint with 112locations in 34countries. Strong localization reduces our exposure to regional market weakness and allows us to achieve market proximity in addressing our customers. In connection with global presence as a strategic field, we have defined ways of making the best possible use of our worldwide Group network. Localization and global network One key measure is the continued localization of our products. This means that we are adapting products even more closely to meet the specific requirements of the individual regional markets and producing on a local basis. This is accompanied by a global strategy for engineeringpage 200,R&Dand supply chain management. We will be distributing our activities in these areas worldwide to an even greater extent than before, taking advantage of the individual­ benefits offered by our locations. Whether it's expertise, cost advan- tages, technological skills or special customer relationships, each location is to contribute its own strengths to the Group network to optimum effect. Centers of competence for specific techno­ logies are increasingly installed in high-growth emerging markets. With respect to production, we are relying on specialized production hubs that assemble their products for the global market on a cost-efficient basis. Focus on Asia Looking ahead over the next few years, Asia offers the greatest growth potential for us. For this reason, we are systematically ­aligning our organizational structures and product strategy to meet the needs of this market. Whereas we already have a strong footprint in China and India, we will be additionally expanding our position in the growth markets of Southeast Asia. STR ATEGIC FIELD: INNOVATION Innovation is a pillar of our market leadership and calls for high R&Dbudgets. The Group's R&Dagenda has two thrusts: Our innovations aim to enable sustainable production processes and unleash added value by means of production efficiency. In this way, we are addressing our customers' two most important requirements. Our product development activities aim at achieving low energy and resource consumption, reduced emissions and low unit costs in production. A further aspect is the flexibilization and modularization of factories. The latter means that we are developing scalable production systems that can be easily expanded depending on the market performance of the product in question. The proportion of digital technologies is widening across practically all innovations. We make our machines and systems intelligent and network them so that they provide greater benefits for users. ­Further information on the innovation strategy and ­current examples can be found in the chapter entitled \"Research and development\" page 33. STR ATEGIC FIELD: EFFICIENCY Efficiency as a strategic field includes an ongoing portfolio ana­ lysis, which measures the performance of and contribution to value made by our activities and identifies the areas in whichadjustments­ are necessary. Efficiency as a strategic field encompasses all initiatives that improve our processes and structures and create a working environ­ ment that promotes performance. The goal is to achieve an ­efficient and flexible organization that contributes to profitability­ and adapts to market changes. One key aspect of this involves ­harnessing synergistic­ effects within the Group. This includes uniform pro- cesses, shared services, the use of economies of scale and end-to- end ITapplications. In the interests of an efficient coststructure,­ we want to merge smaller national companies and pool local activities at larger locations. We have had good experience with this campus­ approach in Germany, the United States and China. 30 ANNUAL REPORT 2019 COMBINED MANAGEMENT REPORT Fundamentals: Strategy In connection with efficiency as a strategic field, we are not losing sight of our employees and managers either. Our Process Excellence approach is designed to enable them to achieve better results with less effort. This is what the \"Better results, less stress\" vision is all about. As an element of Process Excellence, we encourage the use of efficient methods such as lean management and agile working. We adapt processes, improve communications within the organization and promote independence, a sense of ownership and knowledge-sharing. STR ATEGIC FIELD: LIFE CYCLE SERVICES Service business has strategic relevance in two respects as it generates higher margins than new business and directly contributes to customer loyalty. In order to achieve a sustained share of service business of up to 30%of Group sales, we are increasingly aligning our service activities to the entire life cycle of the machinery and systems we install. In doing so, we have three main thrusts: FOUR CENTR AL ENABLERS Operating business is being flanked by four central enablers (supporting­ functions), which are relevant for the successful implementation of our strategy. Sustainability Sustainability is a key motive at several levels of the Group. We develop sustainable products and processes for our customers. At the same time, more and more customers and business partners expect us to provide evidence of sustainable activity. Our trustworthiness as an employer, a partner in the capital market and a partici­ pant in public life also requires us to adopt a responsible approach in our relations with our stakeholders and use of resources, and to observe the principles of corporate citizenship, compliance and good corporate governance. Further information can be found in the chapters entitled\"Sustainability\" and\"Corporate governance\" pages 37 and 45. Mergers and acquisitions By acquiring companies and technologies, we tap growth potential, enter new areas of business and secure our leading market posi- tions. We are continually exploring the market. In doing so, we ­distinguish between cross-divisional and complementary acquisi- tions. Cross-divisional acquisitions are aimed at technologies and skills that benefit several divisions, for example in the software and digital sectors. Complementary acquisitions allow us to reinforce a division's existing business or establish a new division. Acquisition criteria for potential target companies and the establishment of a new division are: ANNUAL REPORT 2019 31 COMBINED MANAGEMENT REPORT Fundamentals: Procurement Finance organization The focus of our financial management is on cost control and the provision of liquidity. The finance organization is a service ­provider for operating business and supports management decision-­making processes. The strategic starting points for enhancing the efficiency of the finance organization entail process standardization and digitalization,­the use of shared services, the optimization of the legal structure and further training for employees. People development Our success as an engineering companypage 200hinges decisively on the qualifications of our employees - particularly in view of ­digitalization and the capabilities that this calls for. We therefore see people development as a strategic task. Specifically, we pursue four approaches: Procurement The Dürr Group's cost of materials came to € 1,681.4million in 2019, rising by 6.9%over the previous year. This was primarily due to increased costs for bought-in parts and for the construction of buildings in systems projects. In plant engineering, we mainly source manufacturing and ­assembly services, as well as modules, aggregates, complete units, engineering services and raw materials for in-house production. In mechanical plant engineering, we purchase a great deal of manu­factured parts and pre-assembled modules. Other important procurement goods for all divisions are finished and semi-finished products such as electrical components and drives. The slowdown in global economic growth has, by and large, caused the capacity utilization among our suppliers to normalize. To ensure supplier availability, we forecast our needs as early as the sales stage. We set store by long-term capacity planning and we closely ­monitor deadlines and milestones when dealing with suppliers­. We have further expanded the systematic sourcing and development of new suppliers. We exclusively produce certain components ourselves in order to protect our intellectual property. We address the pressure on prices exerted by our customers through various measures: We use worldwide framework agreements­ with preferred suppliers; we are stepping up the localization level of products and purchasing activities; and we are increasingly sourc- ing products and components in Asia for plants in other markets­ . We achieve economies of scale by pooling international ­purchasing needs. Our global lead buyers play a crucial role in ­enhancing localization and pooling. To achieve cost benefits, we consider ­purchasing factors early on in our product development. Among the challenges we face in purchasing are the demand-driven fluctuations of our business as well as tight deadlines and cost pressure in plant engineering. In addition, sustainability aspects are becoming increasingly important and are taken into account in ­supplier assessments. Procurement is also hampered in no small part by administrative barriers and customs duties. 32 ANNUAL REPORT 2019 COMBINED MANAGEMENT REPORT Fundamentals: Research and development In digitalizing our purchasing activities, we use, for example, ­digital auctions, electronic supplier integration (EDIand WEB EDIintegra- tion), and automated order confirmation. In the year under review, extensive preparations were made for the Group-wide introduction of a new supplier relationship management (SRM) system. The SRMsystem enables us to further professionalize our supplier management and to benefit from efficient, digital processes and worldwide transparency regarding suppliers and volumes. Implementation is planned for 2020. Other current projects are the SAPintegration of the Megtec/Universal Group and other HOMAGcompanies as well as the introduction of digital business intelligence. We regularly check, especially with major suppliers, to what extent we can achieve additional digital process improvements. As part of a further standardization of our purchasing organi­ zation, we have reviewed our common purchasing manual. A comprehensive training concept ensures the sharing of best practices and a high level of expertise among our purchasing staff. We have ­reorganized the Chinese and German purchasing organization of Paint and Final Assembly Systems as part of the FOCUS 2.0optimization program. We have also remodeled our purchasing activities at Clean Technology Systems following the acquisition of Megtec/ Universal. A new Strategic Sourcing Team works on solutions for strategic purchasing issues in plant engineering. In addition, we have reinforced our project purchasing and supplier development activities in plant engineering. As at December 31, 2019, we had almost 600employees working in purchasing. The Global Sourcing Board coordinates worldwide purchasing operations at Group level. It is made up of the divisions' purchasing heads. The divisions operating under the Dürr brand (Paint and Final Assembly Systems, Application Technology and Clean Technology Systems) use the Global Sourcing Committee for pooling requirements and for deciding on framework agreements as well as major contract awards. Research and development NFD R&D GOALS Our R&Dwork aims to deliver innovations that help our customers achieve maximum production efficiency while lowering per-item costs. In addition, we wish to set ourselves apart from our competi­ tors and safeguard our market-leading position. Great importance is attached to innovations as part of our digital@DÜRRdigital strategy. R&D KEY FIGURES AND EMPLOYEES As part of our measures to secure earnings, we reduced direct R&Dexpenditure in 2019by 8.4%to € 110.8million. However, no cutbacks were made in strategically important areas of innovation, such as digitalization. The R&Dratio reached 2.8%, compared to 3.1%in the previous year. Order-related development costs are contained in the sales costs rather than the direct R&Dcosts. Capitalized develop­ment costs and their amortization totaled € 19.0million and The proportion of the workforce engaged in R&Doperations was 4.8%at year's end 2019, corresponding to 789employees (Decem- ber 31, 2018: 782). We carry out R&Dactivities at sites in Europe, the Americas and China. Almost 90%of R&Dstaff are employed in Germany. Numerous other experts work on new solutions as part of customer orders outside the R&Ddepartments. Responsibility for R&Dlies with the five divisions. The \"R&D/Tech- nology\" cross-functional team coordinates cross-divisionalR&Dactivities and reports to the CEO. Processes and detailed issues relating to R&Dwork are governed by guidelines in the divisions. ANNUAL REPORT 2019 33 COMBINED MANAGEMENT REPORT Fundamentals: Research and development NFD Developing new solutions represents around 70%of our R&Dexpenditure, while some 30%goes on maintaining existing prod- ucts. Our R&Dwork generally focuses on specific products and applications.

The following are currently of particular importance: ȖȖDigitalization/Industrial Internet of Things(IIoT) page 200: The dominant trend in manufacturing technology is digitaliza- tion. This increases our customers' overall equipment effectiveness and enablesadaptive manufacturing processes page 200. One focus in the year under review was on smart applications, including digital maintenance assistants and analytics software for quality improvement. The use of artificial intelligence is playing an increasingly important role. NEW DEVELOPMENTS AND PATENTS 49product innovations were completed in 2019. The number of ­patent families increased to 1,250, and the number of individual patents to 6,861(December 31, 2018: 1,224and 6,651). At 38%, the Application Technology division is responsible for the largest proportion of our patents. The costs for protecting our intellectual property rose to € 9.3million in 2019(2018: € 7.6million), as we had to rely increasingly on external support. lines to be able to offer a wide diversity of models and variants. In doing so, we work on solutions that bypass rigid process chains and can be easily expanded. 2.6 -R&D EMPLOYEES 2019 Woodworking Paint and Final Application Clean Technology Measuring and Machinery and Group Assembly Systems Technology Systems Process Systems Systems Total 789 79 183 34 77 416 % of divisional workforce 4.8 2.2 7.9 2.4 3.4 6.3 34 ANNUAL REPORT 2019 COMBINED MANAGEMENT REPORT Fundamentals: Research and development NFD manufacturers have set themselves targets for when they plan on achieving CO2-neutral production. manufactured efficiently on automated lines. R&D RESULTS Paint and Final Assembly Systems The painting line of the future breaks with traditional painting pro- cesses: Flexible individual boxes for the application of paint replace rigid line concepts whose cycle times are always based on the largest model and the paint with the longest application time. The modular box concept makes car manufacturers more flexible, as it facilitates the painting of different models in one paint shop. In addition, it enables the straightforward expansion of capacities according to NFD customer requirements. EcoProFleet, the world's first automated guided vehicle system specifically for paint shops, is available to complement the above. The freely controllable system transports vehicle bodies flexibly to the individual processing stations. It is precisely adapted to the requirements of the painting environment. Application Technology With EcoPaintJet Pro, Application Technology has taken the appli- cation of paintwithout overspray page 200to the next level. The approximately 50nozzles of the applicator have a diameter of about one tenth of a millimeter and can be controlled individually. This opens up even more possibilities for product customization, such as the sharp application of two colors onto a vehicle roof. As with a digital printer, the automatic application of lettering and logos can also be achieved. Targeted maintenance and improved quality: Thanks to historical data and artificial intelligence, it is now possible to make concrete statements, for example about service requirements. The software DXQequipment.analytics - Advanced Analytics increases the availability and thus the efficiency of the painting robots. Clean Technology Systems Clean Technology Systems continues to drive the improvement in the emissions balance of its exhaust-air purification systems. The newly designed TARcom VIIburner generation will further reduce nitrogen oxide emissions and thus enable compliance with more demanding limits. Measuring and Process Systems We have bundled digital innovations in balancing technologypage 200under the umbrella of the new digital brand, Schenck ONE. The SmartCockpit app makes the information of the connected machines centrally available and thus helps to increase ­productivity in production. Thanks to the MaintenanceCenter maintenance application, customers can plan and document their service work and thus gain a simple overview of the condition and maintenance history of their machines. ANNUAL REPORT 2019 35 COMBINED MANAGEMENT REPORT Fundamentals: Research and development NFD With the x-3Dsurface test stand, the vehicle geometry can be measured even more precisely and quickly at the end of the linepage 200.Vehicle manufacturers can now flexibly define measuring ranges and also inspect complex tire and body shapes with high precision. The retrofitting of existing test systems is possible without difficulty. We have developed new digital applications in filling technologypage 200. For example, they help to manage vehicle-specific parameters and to verify that filling is performed correctly. Thanks to the analysis of historical data, the causes of errors can be detected and eliminated more quickly. Woodworking Machinery and Systems Woodworking Machinery and Systems (HOMAGGroup) has developed easy-to-implement digitalization concepts for woodworking shops and medium-sized furniture manufacturers. Of particular importance in this regard are intuitive assistance apps and - for medium-sized companies - the TRANSBOTautomated guided vehicle system, which transports workpieces between processing stations. The fully automatic multifunctional bridge WALLTEQM-380with integrated blow-in plate has been developed for prefabricated house construction. It can be used to fill wooden elements with insulating materials. Thanks to the digital interface for work preparation, the machine adapts the filling process exactly to the respectiveelement­ . In contrast to manual filling, this reduces processing­ times, waste and dust exposure, thus increasing efficiency andprotecting­ the environment and workers. DÜRR TECHNOLOGY COUNCIL The Dürr Technology Council advises the Board of Management on questions of technology strategy. The Council brings together scientific­ expertise, consultancy skills and senior management experience in the automotive engineering, automation and IT­sectors. Its members are: The Dürr Technology Council sees its role as a think tank and sparring partner for the Board of Management. It balances our innovation strategy against current trends in production and provides advice on the potential of technologies of the future. The Dürr Technology Council maintains constant contact with the Board of Management and, if necessary, exchanges information with the heads of divisions and managers from R&D, software and corporate development departments. It invites different representatives from this circle and external experts to its meetings. In 2019, the Dürr Technology Council convened twice. At the first meeting in Darmstadt, the members were given an overview of Schenck's activities and innovation strategy. The focus was on current­ product developments, including 3D printing and remote-controlled commissioning of balancing machines. ­Specialists from the company presented the innovations and then held discussions with the participants. Other topics of the meeting included battery production­ for electric cars, the ADAMOSjoint venture and the modern ways of thinking and working of digital champions. The second meeting, held at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), initially focused on sustainability aspects of the organizational structure, production, and product development. Another focus was on artificial intelligence, on which, in particular, professors from different departments of the renowned KITgave lectures­ and held discussions with the participants. The members of the Technology Council decided to continue the cooperation with contacts at KIT. The plan is to hold further discussions also on the requirements and opportunities for a consistent sustainability ­orientation of the organization and of product development. NFD 36 ANNUAL REPORT 2019 COMBINED MANAGEMENT REPORT Sustainability SUSTAINABILIT Y Our economic activities are consistent with ecological and social concerns and the principles of responsible corporate governance. We are committed to the ten principles of the UNGlobal Compact. Our activities and results in the area of sustainability are ­regularly evaluated by CSRinitiatives and rating agencies such as the Carbon­ Disclosure Project (CDP) and EcoVadis. In 2019, corporate financing was one of the priorities of our sustainability efforts: The interest­ rates of our new Schuldschein loan and the new syndicated loan are in part linked to the Dürr Group's sustainability rating as determined by EcoVadis. Corporate Sustainability was added to the remit of Dr. Jochen Weyrauch­ on Dürr AG's Board of Management on March 1, 2020. Prior to this, CFOCarlo Crosetto had been responsible for the ­sustainability function. The framework for action is defined by various Group-wide provisions. Measures and initiatives aimed at greater sustainability are usually planned centrally in consultation with the Board of Management and implemented decentrally. Our sustainability reporting does not yet follow any framework. We plan on providing more comprehensive information regarding ­sustainability issues in the Dürr Group and on publishing an independent sustainability report in compliance with the standards of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) in the future.

They form the basis of our code of conduct, which is available in ten languages. It postulates ethically correct behavior and contains principles for social responsibility and for dealing with business partners, 38 ANNUAL REPORT 2019 COMBINED MANAGEMENT REPORT Sustainability: Integrity NFD competitors and colleagues. We also expect our suppliers to exercise the due diligence that we require internally. This requirement is set out in the code of conduct for suppliers, which has been a binding part of our contracts with suppliers since 2019. COMPLIANCE/ANTI-CORRUPTION Our compliance management system (CMS) provides the framework for action so that all activities in daily business operations can be carried out in accordance with legislation and in-house requirements. A Group-wide organizational instruction on compliance defines responsibilities, communication channels and mea- sures. The central body is the Corporate Compliance Board, whose responsibilities include defining and further developing the com­ pliance­ management system. Local compliance managers in the Group companies support the employees in meeting compliance requirements. The Corporate Compliance Officer is the contact person in the case of potential compliance violations and ­notifies the CEOand the Corporate Compliance Board of any ­concrete grounds for ­suspicion. The Board examines the need for other steps on a case-by-case basis. 2.9 -COMPLIANCE MANAGEMENT STRUCTURE CEO Dürr AG reports to reports to Corporate Compliance Corporate Compliance Board Officer reports to Corporate compliance officer, Heads of Internal Auditing, coordinates report to Tax, Legal and HR, Corporate risk manager, Finance managers Group Company of the divisions Compliance Managers With regular compliance training courses that address the issue NFD of corruption, among other things, we inform our employees and raise their awareness. Employees who face particular exposure because of their job are also required to complete advanced train- ing courses on the subject of corruption and fair competition. Our Group-wideanti-corruption organizational instruction provides employees­ with a clear code of conduct for their dealings with ­business ­partners and in the event of conflicts of interest. In 2019, we conducted mandatory online compliance training courses throughout the Group, consisting of a basic training course and refresher courses held every two years. Those employees of the Dürr Systems and Schenck sub-groups who had already received basic compliance training in previous years now completed the refresher course; all others completed the basic training. The training was new for HOMAGemployees, who also participated in the basic training course. In our employee survey of fall 2019, around 90%of participants stated that they were comprehensively informed about compliance issues. Our aim is to prevent the giving and acceptance of bribes from the very outset. No cases of corruption were identified in 2019and 2018. HUMAN RIGHTS It is our aim to ensure that no human rights violations occur in the Dürr Group or at our suppliers. In our code of conduct we have committed ourselves to ensuring that human rights are respected. We do not accept child or forced labor, we are committed to equal opportunities and do not tolerate any form of discrimination. If there is any suspicion of human rights violations of any kind, we check this using the compliance process described. In 2019, we took systematic steps to prevent human rights violations in the supply chain in particular. We purchase the procurement goods and raw materials we need globally. We outsource a great deal of work to suppliers, especially in manufacturing opera- tions. That is why, in the Dürr Systems sub-group, we consider the approach to employee and human rights as early as in the ­supplier selection process. At Dürr Systems, we monitor compliance with human rights as required by our code of conduct for ­suppliers by having included criteria on employee and human rights in our ­supplier audits since 2019. We plan to introduce this concept in other Group companies in the future. ANNUAL REPORT 2019 39 COMBINED MANAGEMENT REPORT Sustainability: Employees Employees As at year's end 2019, the number of employees working in the Group was up 1.1%, totaling 16,493staff (December 31, 2018: 16,312). In Poland and India, we increased our capacities for intra-Groupengineeringservices page 200.Employing external staff enables us to respond to short-term market changes and fluctuations in workload. At year's end 2019, 1,250external staff were working for the Group, equivalent to 7.6%of our regular workforce. Half of our employees are based in Germany. China has the second largest workforce with almost 2,100employees and around 320external staff. The companies in the United States and Poland each account for almost 10%of the Group's workforce. In the emerging markets, the number of employees increased by 2.9%to 5,290­people, equivalent to 32.1%of the total workforce. 2.10 -EMPLOYEES BY DIVISION (DECEMBER 31) 1.7% Corporate Center Paint and Final 22.0% Assembly Systems Woodworking 39.8% Machinery and Systems Application Technology 14.0% Measuring and Clean Techno- 13.9% Process Systems logy Systems 8.6% 2019 2018 2017 Paint and Final Assembly Systems 3,634 3,472 3,457 Application Technology 2,306 2,246 2,063 Clean Technology Systems 1,418 1,472 603 Measuring and Process Systems 2,293 2,279 2,279 Woodworking Machinery and Systems 6,569 6,593 6,371 Corporate Center 273 250 201 Total 16,493 16,312 14,974 2.11 -EMPLOYEES BY REGION (DECEMBER 31) 20.1% Asia, Africa, Australia 2.1% South America Germany 49.6% 12.3% North/ Central America 15.9% Other European countries 2019 2018 2017 Germany 8,181 8,152 7,830 Other European countries 2,617 2,567 2,361 North/Central America 2,028 2,027 1,394 South America 354 341 313 Asia, Africa, Australia 3,313 3,225 3,076 Total 16,493 16,312 14,974 2.12 -PERSONNEL KEY FIGURES 2019 2018 2017 Number of employees (Dec. 31) 16,493 16,312 14,974 of whom apprentices and students at cooperative state universities (Dec. 31) 450 431 420 Proportion of female employees (Dec. 31) (%) 16 16 16 Part-time employees (Dec. 31) 598 507 499 Average length of service (years) 11 11 11 Employee turnover (%) 8.2 9.3 7.7 OUR WORKFORCE The average age of our workforce is 42.

At 21%, the proportion of female employees is highest in China, while the percentage for the Group is 16%. By participating in initiatives such as the Girls' Day, we want to encourage young women to pursue technical apprenticeships and cooperative state university courses, in particular. We are also creating favorable framework conditions throughout the company to better reconcile work and family life, for instance by offering flexible working hours. 40 ANNUAL REPORT 2019 COMBINED MANAGEMENT REPORT Sustainability: Employees 47%of our workforce have a university degree, while 50%have chosen a non-academic, vocational pathway. There are more than 2,100employees working in engineering page 200,while 730staff are responsible for project management - these two areas are particularly­ relevant for our business. Staff working in assembly and manufacturing form the largest function group, accounting for 31%of the workforce. Further personnel key figures can be found in table 2.12. The diversity of our employees has a decisive influence on our cor- porate culture. Part of this is mutual respect - regardless of back- ground, gender, religion or age. According to our code of conduct,­ every employee has the right to be treated fairly, politely and respectfully. NFD PEOPLE DEVELOPMENT AND FURTHER TR AINING Being an engineering company, we must keep pace with the digital transformation and other technological developments. This is why well-qualified specialists and managers are essential for the suc- cess of our company. Our people development and further training programs­ are designed to: digitalization field ȖȖensure the availability of well-qualified managers The Corporate Human Resources department, which reports to the CEO, has overall responsibility for HRissues within the Group. The Corporate People Development department, which is part of Corporate Human Resources, is in charge of people development ­measures and further training. The Group-wide,software-based \"People Development\" process helps us identify, develop and retain potential managers and young talent within our workforce, and to deploy them in the best possible way. At annual people development conferences, people developers and managers share their views on promoting employees with high potential and on internal succession planning. In 2019we applied this process in all three sub-groups (Dürr Systems, Schenck and HOMAG) and identified 44employees with high potential. Another topic was the identification of key positions in the Group. In 2019we launched the Dürr Group Academy, a central forum for further training. The online training platform, which has replaced the previous system, pools the further training activities of all Group companies and is available in 12languages. This means all NFD internal, organized training programs can be accessed online by most employees, and training documentation can be stored in a personalized media center. Aside from online training courses, we also run face-to-face train- ing and seminars. To ensure practice-oriented knowledge trans- fer, we also use internal specialist trainers. In 2019the number of face-to-face training sessions held Group-wide dropped to just under 12,300(2018: around 14,500). This is because, given the dif- ficult market environment and the cost situation, we temporar- ily put on hold some further training measures. The participation rate stood at 0.7training sessions per employee (2018: 0.9). Train- ing events to further build on specialist qualifications accounted for almost half of all attendances. These include training in ITand digitalization as well as technical and commercial expertise. In the digitalization field, we offer training and webinars which provide sales and service employees with the necessary knowledge about new applications. We have expanded our internationally staffed corporate training events. These were attended by a total of 1,454employees in 2019(2018: 1,228). The key topics were leadership, sales and project management as well as technical and commercial knowledge. As part of our corporate training, we offer special training programs for man- agers: \"Fit for Leadership\" for young executives and the \"Advanced Leadership Program\" for experienced managers. Both programs are based on the Dürr Group's Leadership Skills Model and are designed for international participants from various divisions. The \"Fit for Leadership\" program was attended by 358people in 2019(2018: 584), while the \"Advanced Leadership Program\" was attended by 223people (2018: 288). Specially designed for project managers, the \"Leadership Project Management Training\" was attended by 64participants in 2019(2018: 109). The main reason for the lower number of participants in 2019was that we have been running this training since 2016and many managers who belong to the target group have already completed it. HEALTH AND SAFET Y Our divisions' business models pose various safety risks, which we want to minimize through our health and safety measures. The relevant­ instructions and requirements for health and safety and ­accident prevention can be found in our Group-wide and subGroup -specific health and safety guidelines. Cross-functional teams are responsible for developing these guidelines further and for implementing them globally. All Group companies have local health and safety managers, who implement our standards and processes ANNUAL REPORT 2019 41 COMBINED MANAGEMENT REPORT Sustainability: Employees NFD for health and safety locally. Regular internal audits are performed­ to ensure that health and safety guidelines and processes­ at our sites are complied with. The aim of our health and safety Group strategy, \"Striving for Excel- lence in Safety\", is to ensure the physical health of both our own employees and external staff, and to offer them a safe working environment. This is achieved, in particular, through preventative measures such as regular training and ongoing communication on health and safety topics. In 2019we delivered our first online health and safety training, which was compulsory for all Group employees. It replaces or com- plements the site-specific health and safety instructions and will be repeated on a regular basis. Employees exposed to particular risks receive additional, advanced training. In the case of emergencies while traveling, our employees have access to a professional emer- gency management service. Information for employees is published on a quarterly basis to raise awareness of health and safety issues. Our Group-wide health and safety reporting supports manage­ ment in analyzing accidents and serves as a basis for improvement measures. Going beyond accident prevention, we also ensure our employees' wellbeing. We organize wellbeing days and offer numerous fitness packages and health-promoting measures, primarily at our German sites. The Group-wide sick leave rate was 3.1%in 2019(2018: 3.2%). NFD 2.13 -HEALTH AND SAFETY KEY FIGURES EMPLOYEE SATISFACTION AND RETENTION NFD Satisfied and motivated employees are key for our company's success­ . We position ourselves as an attractive employer and boost our employees' satisfaction through various offers and benefits. These include performance-based compensation, further train- ing and career opportunities as well as flexible work arrangements relating to employees' time and attendance, designed to meet our employees' individual needs. Activities to promote work-life balance,­ sports, wellbeing and culture are also aimed at improving satisfaction. Conducted every three years, our employee surveys help us measure employee satisfaction. The latest survey, carried out by an external service provider in the fall of 2019, had a participation rate of 82%, thus exceeding the previous surveys (2016: 77%). The good overall result increased by another 2percentage points compared to 2016on a like-for-like basis. The approval ratings for questions relating to engagement, enjoyment at work and pride in the company were particularly high. Compared with a benchmark group of other industrial companies, we achieved better results for the majority of the questions. There is room for improvement in particular regarding the communication of the corporate strategy, the organization of work processes, and development opportunities. We are developing Group-wide improvement measures to address these issues. EMPLOYEE RECRUITMENT The primary aim of our recruitment work is to fill any vacancies with Number of work-related accidents2 per thousand employees (including external staff, excluding commuting accidents) Work-related accidents2 per 100 thousand hours worked (including external staff, excluding commuting accidents) Work-related accidents2 resulting in death (including external staff) 2019 14.1 0.7 0 201812017 14.8 12.7 0.7 0.6 00 suitable candidates as soon as possible. In 2019around 1,300new employees were hired throughout the Group (2018: almost 1,700). When recruiting new staff, we focus above all on highly qualified experts and digital specialists. In meeting this challenge, we want to use our attractive employer profile and benefit from our reputation as an innovative and digitally oriented company. The Corporate People Development department is responsible for personnel and university marketing. It is in charge of the \"PURE PASSIONEERING\" employer branding campaign for the employer 1 Figures exclude Megtec/Universal 2 A work-related accident is an incident which requires at least medical treatment. brands of Dürr, Schenck and HOMAG. The campaign visualizes our passion for innovative technology and specifically targets software and digitalization specialists. To attract suitable employees from this sought-after target group, we are increasingly relying on existing contacts and taking part in innovative recruitment events such as e-fellows. 42 ANNUAL REPORT 2019 COMBINED MANAGEMENT REPORT Sustainability: Environment NFD In 2019we established contact with graduates and professionals­ at 74university and recruitment fairs worldwide. We promote the development of young academics by offering internships, work experience and opportunities for students to complete their theses­. As a result, 351people entering the job market gained their first practical experience in our company in 2019. In addition to tradi- tional job postings on career pages and employment websites, we are also raising our profile in the labor market through social media such as Twitter, Instagram, Facebook and business networks such as LinkedIn and Xing. Our attractiveness as an employer is underlined by independent awards and rankings: VOCATIONAL TR AINING By offering opportunities for vocational training and study, we promote the development of young skilled personnel from our own ranks. We offer young people vocational training in 14commercial and industrial/technical fields, plus ten study courses in the fields of engineering, business and information technology. In 2019we employed 450apprentices as well as students from cooperative state universities and \"Studium Plus\" students (2018: 431). 66%of them were based at the HOMAGGroup. Our Dürr Graduate Program offers high-achieving university graduates the opportunity to embark on a specialist or management career with good pros- pects, for instance in the fields of technology & innovation, software engineering & IIoT or project management. Environment Guaranteeing sustainability also includes the consideration of ­environmental aspects. We consider the environmental footprint of our own activities and our supply chain as well as the environmental impact of our products. As an engineeringcompany page 200with a low vertical depth of production, our energy, material and resource consumption is relatively low, as is the amount of waste generated. In the supply chain, however, the environmental impact of our business activities is much greater. We take this aspect into account in the purchasing process by means of supplier evaluations and audits. We want to reduce the environmental impacts caused by the use of our products and the associated consumption of resources and energy. For this purpose, we develop efficient and environmentally compatible technologies. Information on this can be found under \"Research and development\" page 33. We will monitor the environmental effects of our direct business­ activities more closely in the future and derive improvement ­measures from this. A Group-wide environmental policy is planned for this purpose. It will describe our understanding of environmentally sustainable management and our efforts in this area, and its purpose is to help reduce the environmental impacts of our activ- ities, for example by reducing energy and water consumption and preventing waste. The environmental policy will provide a framework for action, and the principal responsibility for environmental aspects will continue to lie with the relevant site managers. We continuously measure our consumption of energy and resources and the emissions generated within the Dürr Group. Where it is economically viable, we implement measures for reduction. Compared to 2018, our environmental indicators have largely deteriorated in relation to sales. This is due to the acquisition of the Megtec/­ Universal Group, which uses relatively old production equipment. A large number of our production companies are already certified to the ISO 14001environmental management system. In the future, all production and assembly sites and all sites with technology centers ANNUAL REPORT 2019 43 COMBINED MANAGEMENT REPORT Sustainability: Social commitment are to be certified according to this standard. Eleven HOMAGGroup sites have a certified energy management system to ISO 50001. 2.15 -ENVIRONMENTAL KEY FIGURES (INDEXED) A number of sites carry out energy and quality audits.

The priorities of our support are: ȖȖ Education: training, technology and science, universities, schools, kindergartens ȖȖ Sports: grassroots, youth and disability sports 2 The Dürr Ecoclean Group, which was sold with effect from March 31, 2017, is no longer included in the environmental figures for 2017. 3 Sites used by several companies of the Dürr Group sometimes hold multiple certificates. ȖȖSocial affairs: humanitarian and charitable projects Our social commitment primarily takes place in the neighborhoods of our sites. At our Bietigheim-Bissingen headquarters, we support various educational and social institutions. Examples are the civic foundation, which is committed to affordable housing, early years rhythmical/musical education in children's daycare centers and the mentoring program \"Kinderhelden\" (child heroes) for children with difficult starting conditions. With its \" HOMAGCares\" initia- tive, the HOMAGGroup has been providing donations in kind and cash for over ten years. In 2019, we launched our Group-wide campaign for \"Donations instead of Christmas presents\" and donated around € 70,000to UNICEF, SOSChildren's Villages and Plan International. In 2019, we donated a total of € 0.7million for various charitable purposes (2018: € 0.8million). 44 ANNUAL REPORT 2019 COMBINED MANAGEMENT REPORT Corporate governance: Other information on corporate­ governance CORPORATE GOVERNANCE The German Corporate Governance Code contains rules and recommendations for the reliable management and supervision of listed companies.

No form of discrimination on grounds of gender, age, religion,­ disease, background, skin color, sexual orientation or for any other reason is tolerated at the Dürr Group. We ensure diversity and equal opportunities when hiring staff. Flexible working time models which meet individual needs promote equal opportu- nities. Given the international nature of our business, intercultural ­diversity and tolerance are important values at the Dürr Group. When appointing members to the Board of Management, the Supervisory Board pays particular attention to professional and social skills as well as to long-term experience in similar positions, in our industry and in an international environment. Added to that are character aptitude and an appropriate educational background (university degree or equivalent qualification). Preference is given to neither male nor female candidates. To ensure a balanced age structure, the age limit for members of the Board of Management is, generally, 63. DISCLOSURES PURSUANT TO SECTIONS 289A (1) AND 315A (1) OF THE GERMAN COMMERCIAL CODE (HGB) ANNUAL REPORT 2019 47 COMBINED MANAGEMENT REPORT Corporate governance: Other information on corporate­ governance Such covenants are customary practice and are included in comparable form in the terms of the bonds of other issuers. They serve to protect the interests of the bondholders. Schuldschein loan: The terms of our Schuldschein loan agreement stipulate that, in the event of a change of control, the lenders­ have the right to demand redemption of the Schuld- schein loan. A change of control occurs if: one person or a ­majority of people acting in concert holds more than 50%of the shares; can control more than 50%of the voting rights and/or the company's course of business; and/or has the power to appoint more than 50%of the members of the Board of Management­. The lenders of the Schuldschein loan has the right to demand redemption within 30days of the notification of the change of control by the borrower. Redemption shall be due by the next interest payment date. Syndicated loan: The terms of our syndicated loan agreement stipulate that, in the event of a change of control, no additional cash drawings or applications for guarantees may be made. In addition, any lender can cancel the credit commitments it has made, which could result in the syndicated loan having to be repaid in part or even in full. The agent representing the ­interests of the banking syndicate must be informed about a change of control immediately after it becomes known. A change of control occurs if in total, directly or indirectly, more than 50%of the voting rights in Dürr AGare held or controlled by one or more persons who have come to an accord on the exercising of voting rights or who collaborate in some other manner with the aim of achieving a lasting and substantial change in the business focus of Dürr AG. The employment contract of a member of the Board of Manage­ ment contains an arrangement that applies in the event of a take- over. If a change of control should occur, this arrangement offers an option for a defined period for the Board of Management member to terminate the contract himself with capitalization of all the contractual remuneration components and of the company pension as a severance payment. The severance payment is limited to a maximum of three fixed annual salaries­ (basic com- pensation); the severance payment relating to the short-term incentive and the pension is limited to the current financial year at the time and the two subsequent financial years. In all cases, the basis on which the severance payment is calculated does not go beyond the remaining term of the Board member's contract of employment. Any long-term-incentive components already granted are also included in the severance payment. 48 ANNUAL REPORT 2019 COMBINED MANAGEMENT REPORT Corporate governance: 2019 compensation report 2019 compensation report In addition to the details below, the information contained in item 42in the notes to the consolidated financial statements is part of this compensation report.

REGUL AR REVIEW The Supervisory Board Personnel Committee reviews the compensation system for the Board of Management at regular intervals and draws up proposals for its further development where necessary. The Supervisory Board examines these recommendations carefully and passes its resolutions on that basis. The appropriateness of the Board of Management's compensation is assessed using several­ criteria. These include the tasks of the Board of Management as a whole and of its respective members, the members' personal perfor- mance, the economic situation as well as the company's long-term success and outlook. In addition, the Supervisory Board ­follows the development of the Board of Management's compensation in comparison with other companies from the relevant industry as well as with the Group's top management team and workforce. The current compensation system has been in place since 2010. All contracts of the Management Board members include short-term and long-term incentives (variable compensation calculated over a period of one and several years, respectively), payment caps and a deductible that applies in connection with D&O(directors' and ­officers') liability insurance policies in case of liabilities. COMPONENTS OF THE COMPENSATION SYSTEM The compensation for the Board of Management consists of non-performance-related and performance-related (variable) components. The non-performance-related component is made up of the basic compensation (fixed compensation) payable in equal monthly installments, plus fringe benefits. The latter include the use of a company car, for example. Performance-related compensation is based on short-term and long-term incentives; special bonuses may also be paid. The short- term incentive (STI) is calculated by multiplying the Group's earnings before tax (EBT) minus € 100million by an individually defined factor. For Ralf W. Dieter this individual factor is 0.01, for Carlo ­Crosetto it is 0.004and for Pekka Paasivaara and Dr. Jochen Weyrauch it is 0.005each. The STIpayment is subject to a cap and is only applicable if the Group's EBTexceeds the mini­ mum threshold of € 100million. Please see chart 2.20for more information. The compensation payable under the long-term incentive (LTI) scheme is based on the development of Dürr's share price and the Group's average EBITmargin over a three-year period (LTIperiod). The LTIscheme operates on a rolling basis; ten LTItranches have been issued since its introduction in 2010. Each year a specified number of virtual Dürr shares are issued, known as performance share units. In 2019, the following performance share units were issued: 50,000for Mr. Dieter, 6,000for Mr. Crosetto and 8,000each for Mr. Paasivaara and Dr. Weyrauch. The amount payable at the end of the three-yearLTIperiod is calculated by multiplying the number of performance share units by a share price multiplier and an EBITmultiplier. The share price multiplier corresponds to the average closing price of the Dürr share in euros in the last 20trading days prior to the first annual general meeting after the three- year LTIperiod. The EBITmultiplier is calculated on the basis of the average EBITmargin achieved by the Group during the term of the LTItranche. The overall LTIpayment and the EBITmultiplier are subject to caps. The EBITmultiplier reaches its maximum of two if an average EBITmargin of at least 8%has been achieved. If the average EBITmargin is 4%or below, the EBITmultiplier is zero, and therefore no LTIpayment is made. During the term of theLTI scheme, the participants must hold a certain number of Dürr shares for the duration, in order to be awarded the maximum number of performance share units. The participants must purchase the Dürr shares with their own funds. Mr. Dieter must hold50,000 shares, Dr. Weyrauch and Mr. ­Paasivaara must each hold6,000 shares, and for Mr. Crosetto the number of shares was4,500 (total number of shares to be held after the thirdLTI tranche). TheLTI target achievement is illustrated using the example shown in chart2.21.

This contribution (benefit) is made up of 10%of the basic compensation and 10%of the previous year's STI, and is paid into the Dürr pension plan. The CEOadditionally receives a fixed annual pension contribution of € 400thousand by December 31, 2020. The pension scheme is the Group's defined benefit company pension plan based on a reinsurance scheme. If a member of the Board of Management resigns from office, no further expenses will be incurred under this scheme. The Supervisory Board can agree targets with the members of the Board of Management for the further strategic development of the Group, and pay an additional bonus if these have been successfully implemented. A special bonus may also be paid for exceptional performance and successful achievements and/or if a member of the Board of Management takes on additional responsibilities. The special bonus is also subject to a cap, equivalent to the difference between the sum of the defined maximum individual compensation payments and the maximum total compensation. Aside from the Board of Management, other top managers also ­participate in the LTIscheme. They, too, must purchase an individually defined number of Dürr shares and hold them for the ­duration in order to be awarded the maximum number of performance share units. COMPENSATION FOR 2019 Total compensation expense for the Board of Management in 2019was € 7,106thousand. The main reason for the increase of 5.5%over the previous year (€ 6,737thousand) is that the Board of Management grew from three to four members following the appointment of Mr. Paasivaara on January 1, 2019. Prior to that, the compensation­ for Mr. Paasivaara had been paid by the Woodworking Machinery and Systems division. Former members of the Board of Management received pension benefits in the amount of € 554thousand in 2019(2018: € 550thousand). The LTIexpenses shown in table 2.19include the amounts recognized as liabilities on a pro-rata basis for the current LTItranches. The share price multiplier used for the 2019compensation was calculated based on the average closing price of the Dürr share in the last 20trading days in December 2019. This is because the average closing price in the last 20trading days prior to the 2020annual general meeting was, of course, not known at the time. The following­ should be noted regarding Mr. Crosetto's compensation­ shown in table 2.19: Following his departure from the Board of Management on February 29, 2020, all LTIpayments were made to Mr. ­Crosetto ahead of sched- ule. For this purpose, the relevant parameters - EBITmultiplier and share price multiplier - were calculated on an individual basis. In 2019, Ralf W. Dieter received a total payment of € 1,200thousand from the 2016to 2018 LTItranche. Mr. Paasivaara­ and Dr. Weyrauch­ have not yet received any LTIpayments, since they only joined the Board of Management in 2017and 2019, respectively. 50 ANNUAL REPORT 2019 COMBINED MANAGEMENT REPORT Corporate governance: 2019 compensation report € Basic compensation (fixed compensation) Fringe benefits (payments in kind, allowances related to insurance premiums etc.) Total One-year variable compensation (STI) Total of multi-year variable compensation (LTI) Variable compensation LTI 2016 - 2018 Variable compensation LTI 2017 - 2019 Variable compensation LTI 2018 - 2020 Variable compensation LTI 2019 - 2021 Other variable compensation Total Benefit obligation contribution Total compensation CARLO CROSETTO CFO 2018 2019 2019 (min) 2019 (max) 500,000 500,000 500,000 500,000 16,590 15,989 15,989 15,989 516,590 515,989 515,989 515,989 478,720 298,872 0 700,000 129,203 377,166 0 450,000 - - - - 44,415 125,722 0 150,000 84,788 125,722 0 150,000 - 125,722 0 150,000 0 158,512 0 214,011 1,124,513 1,350,539 515,989 1,880,000 106,618 97,872 50,000 120,000 1,231,131 1,448,411 565,989 2,000,000 PEKKA PAASIVAARA Member of the Board of Management (from: Jan 1, 2019) 2018 2019 2019 (min) 2019 (max) - 525,000 525,000 525,000 - 18,000 18,000 18,000 - 543,000 543,000 543,000 - 373,590 0 875,000 - 53,377 0 200,000 - - - - - - - - - - - - - 53,377 0 200,000 - 0 0 329,500 - 969,967 543,000 1,947,500 - 52,500 52,500 52,500 - 1,022,467 595,500 2,000,000 The Supervisory Board granted Mr. Crosetto a special bonus of STI (€): (EBT reporting year - 100)*individual factor million) 1.6 (€ 1.4 compensation 1.2 1.0 0.8 variable 0.6 0.4 -year 0.2 0 1 STI 0 80 100 120 140 160 180 200 220 240 260 275 300 Dürr Group EBT (€ million) Cap Ralf W.

COMPENSATION SYSTEM FOR THE SUPERVISORY BOARD The compensation paid to the members of the Supervisory Board is set out in Article 15of Dürr AG's articles of incorporation. The full text is available on our website www.durr-group.com under Inves- tors/Corporate Governance. The compensation system for the Supervisory Board stipulates that each member receives a fixed annual compensation payment of € 40,000. Members are also entitled to a € 1,000attendance fee for each meeting attended, plus reimbursement of expenses. The variable compensation is based on the three-year rolling average EBTmargin and must not exceed to a regular member. The compensation paid to the members of the Audit Committee is € 10,000per year, while the members of the Personnel Committee receive € 5,000per year. The Chairs of both committees receive three times the compensation paid to a regular mem- ber; this is based on a resolution passed at the 2019annual ­general meeting. Prior to that, they had received twice (Audit ­Committee) and one and a half times (Personnel ­Committee) the compensation paid to a regular member. The members of the Nominating Committee are entitled to a compensation payment of € 2,500per meeting, with the Chair receiving one and a half times that amount. Any members serving on the Supervisory Board or a committee for a part of the fiscal year only are remunerated­ pro rata temporis. Total compensation paid to the members of the Supervisory Board in 2019was € 1,161thousand, after € 1,151thousand in the previous year. Information on the individual compensation payments made to the members of the Supervisory Board can be found in item 42in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. PERFORMANCE-REL ATED COMPENSATION FOR OTHER EMPLOYEES Non-tariff employees receive a basic annual salary plus a performance -related bonus. The bonus is linked to the achievement of financial and personal performance targets. In most cases it is between 5and 10%of the basic salary, but higher for managers. Tariff employees at almost all German Group companies receive a profit-­sharing bonus, which is subject to earnings exceeding a certain threshold pre-agreed with the works council. For 2019, the ­profit-sharing bonus payable to full-time tariffemployees­ of the Dürr Group in Germany is € 2,000. 52 ANNUAL REPORT 2019 COMBINED MANAGEMENT REPORT Business report: Economy and industry environment­ BUSINESS REPORT Economy and industry environment GLOBAL ECONOMY IN 2019: WEAKER GROW TH Although the global economy remained on the upward trajectory of the previous years in 2019, it did so at a slower pace: At 3.0%, growth The exchange rates of the main currencies have fluctuated in only relatively narrow ranges over the past three years. The euro was temporarily strong in 2018but weakened against the other main currencies again in 2019, something which benefited export-­ oriented companies in Germany. 2.24 -AVERAGE EXCHANGE RATES fell appreciably short of the previous year's figure of 3.8%. This was due to mounting uncertainty in the wake of the trade ­disputes, together with problems such as Brexit and the Iran conflict. As table 2.23shows, nearly all the major economies experienced slower growth. One exception was Japan with its very expansionary fiscal policy. Interest rates and prices in the global market for commodities and energy remained largely unchanged in 2019. € 1 equals 2019 USD 1.1197 GBP 0.8757 JPY 121.9792 CNY 7.7175 Source: Commerzbank 20182017 1.1792 1.1371 0.8862 0.8764 129.9983 127.3383 7.8167 7.6614 2.23 -GROWTH IN GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT CURRENT YIELD IN GERMANY SLIGHTLY BELOW 0 % Source: Commerzbank 01/2020 2019 3.0 0.5 1.2 1.3 2.3 6.2 5.0 1.2 1.1 20182017 3.83.7 1.52.2 1.92.4 1.61.5 2.92.2 6.66.9 7.66.7 0.71.7 1.11.0 In Germany, the current yield on bonds continued its downward trend, reaching negative territory in 2019at -0.1%(2018: 0.1%). Despite rising wages and salaries, the inflation rate in Europe was low. The ECBmaintained its low interest rate policy and left the key interest rate unchanged at 0%; in the fall of 2019it resumed the bond purchasing operations that had been suspended at the beginning of the year. In the equity markets, the key indices posted gains in 2019, one ­reason for this being the copious liquidity available to investors. The DAXposted a positive performance of 25%for the year as a whole, thus more than recouping the previous year's decline of 18%. The more cyclical stocks in the automotive and capital goods sectors­ underperformed the market as a whole, with many companies in both these sectors scaling back their earnings guidance for 2019and 2020.

At the beginning of the year, many industry observers had still been expecting growth. The decline was particularly pronounced in China (down 8%), where the trade dispute with the United States and decreasing government incentives took their toll on demand for vehicles. Even so, Chinese automotive production reached 24.4million units, thus accounting for 27%of the global total. Production also contracted in most of the other major ­markets. One reason for this was the reticence of many consumers to buy cars ahead of the technology change toward electromobility. Despite the sell-side problems, capital spending on machinery and plant increased in the automotive industry. This was mainly due to the growing need for production technology for electric vehicles on the part of both automotive incumbents and new OEMs. More- over, many automotive OEMs expanded their production capacity in foreign markets to be able to produce locally and to lower their exposure to trade conflicts. 2.26 -PRODUCTION OF LIGHT VEHICLES Million units 2019 2018 2017 Global 89.5 94.2 95.2 Western Europe 13.6 14.3 14.8 Germany 4.9 5.3 5.9 Eastern Europe 7.5 7.5 7.2 Russia 1.6 1.7 1.5 North America (incl.

Although ­spending on plant and equipment nominally rose by just under 2%, this was tantamount to stagnation in real terms. According to 54 ANNUAL REPORT 2019 COMBINED MANAGEMENT REPORT Business report: Explanatory notes on the figures figures released by the German Mechanical Engineering Industry Association (VDMA), production contracted by 2%, after expanding by 2%in 2018. VDMAreported a sharp 9%decline in order intake as a result of domestic and foreign weakness. SHARPER DECLINE IN WOODWORKING MACHINERY The VDMAtrade association responsible for the woodworking machinery segment reported a 2%decline in sales for the period from January through November 2019. It should be borne in mind in connection with this relatively moderate decline that many companies benefited at the beginning of the year from working off their high order backlogs. The decline in order intake accelerated: After dropping by 6%in the previous year, new orders fell by 12%in the period from January through November 2019. One reason for this was soft demand in the Chinese furniture industry, which was dragged down by higher USimport tariffs and low capacity utiliza- tion. This was exacerbated by weak capital spending requirements after heavy spending on the part of many Chinese furniture producers in 2017. One encouraging sign, however, was the fact that the HOMAGGroup was awarded a big-ticket system order again in the third quarter of 2019, after a prolonged dry spell in China. Explanatory notes on the figures The charts and tables in this management report generally contain IFRSfigures for the years from 2017through 2019. EBIT EBITis defined as earnings before interest, income taxes and income from investments. Extraordinary effects are eliminated from operating EBIT; these extraordinary effects are listed in table 2.40. ACCOUNTING: FIRST-TIME APPLICATION OF IFRS 16 We have been applying the new accounting standard IFRS 16\"Leases\" since January 1, 2019. The most important change is that lessees must now recognize all main leases as right-of-use assets and the matching payment obligations as liabilities. The application of the new standard did not have any material impact on the Dürr Group's results of operations, although it did lead to shifts within the income statement. Certain key balance sheet figures and the cash flows from operating and financing activities have been influenced by the application of IFRS 16, in some cases significantly. When comparing periods, it should be borne in mind that the figures for 2018and 2017were not calculated in accordance with IFRS 16. Detailed information on the application of IFRS 16can be found in item 6of the notes to the consolidated financial statements. 2.27 -IMPACT OF FIRST-TIME APPLICATION OF IFRS 16 ON PERFORMANCE INDICATORS 2019 Impact from the application of € million 2018 2019 IFRS 16 KEY FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE INDICATORS Order intake 3,930.9 4,076.5 - Sales 3,869.8 3,921.5 - EBIT 233.5 195.9 1.7 EBIT margin (%) 6.0 5.0 - ROCE (%) 24.0 16.9 -1.3 pp OTHER FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE INDICATORS EBITDA 326.9 308.5 29.6 Net finance expense -13.8 -21.2 -3.0 Earnings before taxes (EBT) 219.7 174.7 -1.3 Cash flow from operating activities 162.3 171.9 29.5 Free cash flow 78.4 44.9 - Capital expenditure1 74.4 102.62 26.3 Non-current assets (December 31) 1,244.3 1,322.4 92.2 Current assets (December 31) 2,370.1 2,560.0 -0.1 Equity (December 31) 992.2 1,043.4 -10.5 Total assets (December 31) 3,614.4 3,882.3 92.2 Net financial status -99.3 -101.2 (December 31) 32.3 ¹ Net of acquisitions 2 Since 2019, capital expenditure has also included additions to right-of-use assets under leases (IFRS 16). REPORTING CONVENTIONS With the exception of IFRS 16, amendments to IFRSs in 2019had only a limited impact on the presentation of Dürr's business sit- uation. Relatively few reporting options are available under the IFRSs and their utilization barely impacts our net assets, financial position and results of operations. They can be used, for example, in connection with inventories or property, plant and equipment. ANNUAL REPORT 2019 55 COMBINED MANAGEMENT REPORT Business report: Overall assessment by the Board of Management and target achievement In the case of important balance sheet items, we exercise options in such a way that the greatest possible measurement continuity is preserved. We made use of most of the reporting options in unchanged form in 2019. Similarly, the use of accounting measures exerted at most only a minor influence on the presentation of the results of operations. Moreover, it is inconsistent in many cases with our commitment to continuity and cross-period transparency. HOMAG GROUP AG: DOMINATION AND PROFIT AND LOSS TR ANSFER AGREEMENT Under the terms of the domination and profit and loss transfer agreement entered into between Dürr Technologies GmbH and HOMAGGroup AG, all of the net profit earned by theHOMAGGroup AGaccrues to the Dürr Group.

Instead, they receive a guaranteed dividend of € 1.01per share (net) for the duration of the domination and profit and loss transfer agreement. In addition, we have submitted a cash settlement offer of € 31.56per share to them. The interest expense ­arising from the domination and profit and loss transfer agreement with HOMAGGroup AG(2019: € 5.6million) is recognized within the Dürr Group's financial result. In valuation proceedings, external shareholders of HOMAGGroup AGare having the amount of the guaranteed dividend and cash settlement reviewed in court. Under a ruling by the Regional Court of Stuttgart in August 2019, the cash compensation was to be increased to € 31.58and the guaranteed dividend to € 1.03per share (net). However, the ruling is not final as HOMAGGroup AGshareholders filed an appeal against it in October2019. The valuation proceedings will in all likelihood continue soon after the conclusion­ of the appeal proceedings before the Higher Regional Court of ­Stuttgart. Pending a decision by that court, the amounts originally set for the guaranteed dividend and the cash settlement (€ 1.01net and € 31.56, respectively) continue to apply. SALE OF THE DÜRR ECOCLEAN GROUP When comparing the years 2019, 2018and 2017, it should be borne in mind that we sold the Dürr Ecoclean Group (industrial ­cleaning tech- nology) effective March 31, 2017. In the first quarter of2017, the Dürr Ecoclean Group had contributed order intake of € 51.1million, sales of € 47.5million and EBITof € 2.2million to the Dürr Group, specifically the Measuring and Process Systems division­. The ­proceeds of € 107.9million from the sale of 85%of Dürr Ecoclean's capital accrued to us on March 31, 2017, with the book gain of € 23.0million entered as extraordinary income within the Corporate Center. ACQUISITION OF MEGTEC/UNIVERSAL A comparison of individual periods for the Group and Clean Technology­ Systems must take account of the acquisition in 2018of the Megtec/Universal Group, which specializes in exhaust-air ­purification technology. Megtec/Universal contributed order intake of € 46.1million, sales of € 47.6million and EBITof € 2.7million (before purchase price allocation) in 2018from the date of initial consolidation (October 5). ISSUE OF BONUS SHARES/EARNINGS PER SHARE Following the issue of bonus shares, the number of shares in Dürr AGdoubled to 69,202,080on June 22, 2018. The earnings per share reported in the management report for the years 2017to 2019were calculated on the basis of 69,202,080shares. Overall assessment by the Board of Management and target achievement 2019was characterized by pronounced economic weakness and challenging market conditions. The automotive industry recorded a 5%decline in global production. Demand from the furniture industry at the HOMAGGroup fell by just under 9%, with systems business comprising complete furniture production lines virtually­ ­collapsing in the first half of the year. Nevertheless, we were able to meet our Group forecasts for order intake and sales and achieve new record levels in both cases. The fact that order intake rose above € 4billion for the first time is partly due to our strong position in automotive business. Moreover, environmental technology business achieved the growth targets sought with the acquisition of Megtec/Universal. Earnings were impacted by the market­ downturn in the furniture industry, structural shortcomings in the HOMAGGroup and - to a lesser extent - market-related declines in the Measuring and Process Systems division. In addition, there were extraordinary expenses of € 67.2million (including purchase price allocation effects, see table 2.40). Of this, an amount of 56 ANNUAL REPORT 2019 COMBINED MANAGEMENT REPORT Business report: Overall assessment by the Board of Management and target achievement The Dürr Group's order intake increased by 3.7%to € 4,076.5million in 2019, thus reaching the upper end of the target corridor (€ 3,800to 4,100million). Adjusted for currency-translation effects, the increase would have been 2.1%. A strong fourth quarter, which ­produced new orders of € 1,216.9million, was the main contributor­ to this good performance. Our automotive business benefited from the strong demand for production technology for electric vehicles and was largely driven by new e-mobilityOEMs. Order intake in Clean Technology Systems rose to € 449.1million (2018: At € 3,921.5million, sales also reached the target range (€ 3,900to 4,100million). Sales growth was a relatively slow 1.3%. It was underpinned by significant growth in service business (7.7%) and the full- year inclusion of Megtec/Universal in Clean Technology Systems­ . Paint and Final Assembly Systems posted a slight increase in sales, while the three other divisions fell short of the previous year's ­figures. Adjusted for exchange rate effects, sales would have been flat. We adjusted the target corridor for the operating EBITmargin on July 22from between 7.0and 7.5%to between 6.0and 6.5%. The main rationale for this was the market downturn afflicting the HOMAGGroup, which was accompanied by high material and personnel costs as well as declining sales in China. At the Group level, we achieved an operating EBITmargin of 6.7%, which was above the target corridor. This was underpinned by the noticeable improvement in the operating EBITof all the divisions in the second half of the year compared with the first half. We adjusted our target for the EBITmargin after extraordinary effects from between 6.5and 7.0%to a corridor of 5.5to 6.0%in July and lowered it to between 4.4and 4.9%on November 6. The reason for the second adjustment was the extraordinary expenses of € 36.6million for the package of measures implemented for the HOMAGGroup and an amount of € 6.0million in connection with a legal dispute. At 5.0%, we exceeded the adjusted target corridor at the end of the year. As expected, net finance expense increased from € 13.8million to corridor of € 115to 130million defined in November. Standing at 16.9%, ROCEpage 201reached the upper end of the target range of 12to 17%that had been adjusted in November. ­Initially, we had been expecting 20to 30%or - since July 2019- 15to 20%. The step-by-step reduction in the ROCEtarget level was mainly due to the adjustments made to the EBITguidance explained above. Cash flow from operating activities exhibited a pattern that is not untypical of the Dürr Group: A muted first half was followed by a much brisker second half. Prepayments and progress payments from customers were particularly encouraging in the final quarter, while at the same time we were able to significantly reduce inven- tories. The result was a very high cash flow of € 233.2million from operating activities in the fourth quarter, which resulted in a figure of € 171.9million for 2019as a whole. In this way, we achieved our original goal of improving cash flow. The net financial statuspage 201benefited from the high cash flow at the end of the year and, at €-99.3million, was better than planned in July (€-180to -130million). Capital expenditure was also influenced by IFRS 16, rising to € 102.6million in line with expectations as additions to right-of-use assets under leases were included for the first time. DIVISIONS: MOST TARGETS ACHIEVED The five divisions performed disparately in 2019, but most of them achieved and, in some cases, exceeded their full-year targets. At Paint and Final Assembly Systems, new orders exceeded the prior-­year figure as well as the target range. The main reasons for this were a strong fourth quarter and growth in e-mobility business and in North America. Sales reached the middle of the ­target corridor. At 4.1%, the EBITmargin remained muted in the first half of the year but improved in the third and fourth quarters as announced, reaching a very solid full-year figure of 5.0%in line with our expectations. This was due to two factors: the execution of higher-­margin orders and the positive effects of the FOCUS 2.0optimization program. Application Technology achieved record order intake. Its subdued sales performance was due to the relatively low order intake in the second half of 2018; in addition, service business temporarily dipped due to the low capacity utilization of many paint shops. EBITcame under pressure in the final quarter from extraordinary expenses of ANNUAL REPORT 2019 57 COMBINED MANAGEMENT REPORT Business report: Overall assessment by the Board of Management and target achievement 2.28 -GROUP TARGET ACHIEVEMENT IN 2019 2019 target 2019 target 2019 target (February 2019 (July 2019 (November 2019 2018 act. 2019 act. forecast) forecast) forecast) Order intake € million 3,930.9 4,076.5 3,800-4,100 3,800-4,100 3,800-4,100 Orders on hand (December 31) € million 2,577.2 2,742.8 2,400-2,900 2,400-2,900 2,400-2,900 Sales € million 3,869.8 3,921.5 3,900-4,100 3,900-4,100 3,900-4,100 EBIT margin % 6.0 5.0 6.5-7.0 5.5-6.0 4.4-4.9 EBIT margin before extraordinary effects % 7.1 6.7 7.0-7.5 6.0-6.5 6.0-6.5 ROCE % 24.0 16.9 20-30 15-20 12-17 Net finance expense € million -13.8 -21.2 Deterioration Deterioration Deterioration Tax rate % 25.6 25.7 27-28 27-28 27-28 Earnings after taxes € million 163.5 129.8 175-190 145-160 115-130 Up on the Down on the Down on the Cash flow from operating activities € million 162.3 171.9 previous year previous year previous year Up on the Down on the Down on the Free cash flow € million 78.4 44.9 previous year previous year previous year Net financial status (December 31) € million 32.3 -99.3 -60to  -20 -180to -130 -180to  -130 Liquidity € million 655.0 662.0 660-700 740-790 740-790 Capital expenditure1 € million 74.4 102.62 80-90 80-90 95-105 1 Net of acquisitions 2 Since 2019, capital expenditure has also included additions to right-of-use assets under leases (IFRS 16). Clean Technology Systems increased its business sharply as a result of the full-year consolidation of the Megtec/Universal group. Order intake was very encouraging and reached the upper end of the ­target range. By contrast, sales were slightly below target, as ­revenue recognition was initially subdued due to factors related to capacity utilization before rising sharply at the end of the year. The EBITmargin widened significantly and, at 3.1%, was slightly above the target range. Measuring and Process Systems achieved the target corridor for order intake thanks to a strong first half. Sales initially suffered from weak new orders in the second half of 2018and declining business in balancing systems for combustion engine components. However, it caught up in the second half of the year, allowing the division to reach the target corridor. Reflecting the initial weakness in sales and high R&D expenditure for digitalization, the EBIT­margin remained muted in the first half of the year at 6.9%, but subsequently improved significantly and, at 9.4%for the year as a whole, moved closer to the target corridor of 10to 11%as adjusted in July. Weaker market conditions in business with the furniture ­industry left traces on order intake (down 8.8%) and sales (down 1.5%) in Woodworking Machinery and Systems. EBITwas also impacted by high costs, low business volumes in China, structural shortcomings and the extraordinary expenses for structural measures and purchase price allocation. We consider the structural measures and process improvements that have been initiated to constitute investments in the future of Woodworking Machinery and Systems and to achieve an appropriate level of profitability (targetEBITmargin of over 9%by 2023at the latest). We adjusted our targets for 2019in July and November in response to the market downturn and the adverse effects on earnings; please see table 2.29.

This section also contains information on the non-financial performance indicators. Please also note the non-financial consolidated declaration in connection with the non-financial disclosures and performance indicators. MAIN EVENTS DRIVING BUSINESS PERFORMANCE Events and factors that had a significant impact on the Dürr Group's results of operations, financial condition and net assets in 2019entailed the decline in the HOMAGGroup's business, the structural measures adopted at the HOMAGGroup in November and the sustainability -oriented Group refinancing initiated in the summer. Demand in automotive business was somewhat up on the good prior-­year level and was buoyed by high capital expenditure on production­ technology for electric cars. Business performance ORDER INTAKE IN EXCESS OF € 4 BILLION FOR THE FIRST TIME In 2019, order intake rose by 3.7%to € 4,076.5million, thus exceeding the threshold of € 4billion for the first time. On the basis of like­ -for-like exchange rates, new orders would have climbed by 2.1%. At 74.0%, Clean Technology Systems posted the greatest growth in new orders. This was primarily due to the full-year consolidation of Megtec/Universal. However, even adjusted for this effect, the division still achieved an increase at a percentage rate in the high ­single digits. Painting technology business also expanded despite the challenging market conditions facing the automotive industry, as demonstrated by the growth of 3.1%in Paint and Final Assembly­ Systems and 1.3%in Application Technology. Measuring and ­Process Systems posted the second-highest increase in orders of 5.6%. By contrast, order intake for Woodworking Machinery and Systems dropped by 8.8%due to the contraction of the furniture industry market. However, it should be noted that, after muted conditions in the first half of the year, order intake picked up in the second­ half of the year, falling only slightly short of the comparison ­figure for the previous year. ANNUAL REPORT 2019 59 COMBINED MANAGEMENT REPORT Business report: Business performance Order intake from the emerging markets dropped by 8.5%over the previous year to € 1,659.3million, accounting for 40.7%of total new orders within the Group (2018: € 1,814.1million and 46.1%, respec- tively). New orders in China contracted by 20.3%to € 704.3million due to a temporary dip in order intake in automotive business. By contrast, other emerging markets such as India and Brazil, posted what in some cases were substantial gains. Demand was the ­strongest in North and Central America, where a very high order intake of € 1,217.2million was achieved on growth of 72.6%. This performance was underpinned by strong demand in the auto­ motive industry, which increased capital expenditure on production technology­ for electric vehicles in particular. Order intake in Europe (including Germany) was down 10.9%on the previous strong year. All in all, our order intake shows a good international distribution, confirming our ability to seize market opportunities all around the world. fluctuation. With orders worth € 1,216.9million, the final quarter of 2019was the strongest quarter in the previous five years. 2.30 -CONSOLIDATED ORDER INTAKE BY SALES REGION 29.2% Asia, Africa, Germany 13.5% Australia Other 2.6% South America European 24.9% countries 29.9% North/ Central America € million 2019 2018 2017 Germany 548.8 753.6 592.7 Other European countries 1,016.0 1,003.0 1,170.5 North/Central America 1,217.2 705.1 820.9 South America 104.5 80.0 92.1 Asia, Africa, Australia 1,189.9 1,389.3 1,126.8 Total 4,076.5 3,930.9 3,803.0 2.31CONSOLIDATED ORDER INTAKE BY QUARTER € million 1,200 1,216.9 1,177.7 1,105.9 1,019.1 1,044.5 1,033.9 1,000 935.9 938.6 896.4 800 815.1 798.2 828.3 600 400 200 0 Q1/19 Q1/18 Q1/17 Q2/19 Q2/18 Q2/17 Q3/19 Q3/18 Q3/17 Q4/19 Q4/18 Q4/17 60 ANNUAL REPORT 2019 COMBINED MANAGEMENT REPORT Business report: Business performance SLIGHT INCREASE IN SALES Sales rose by 1.3%in 2019to a new record of € 3,921.5million. Adjusted for currency-translation effects, it would have remained steady at the previous year's level. Paint and Final Assembly Systems continued on its growth trajectory with a moderate increase of 0.7%. Sales in Clean Technology Systems climbed by 74.4%, primarily as a result of the full- year inclusion of Megtec/Universal; adjusted for this effect, it would have expanded by a percentage rate in the low double digits. The declines posted by Application Technology (down 9.2%) and ­Measuring and Process Systems (down 10.1%) reflected temporarily­ weaker order intake in the second half of 2018. The more muted market in business with the furniture industry left traces on Woodworking Machinery and Systems (down 1.5%).

As a rule, our sales are higher in the third and fourth quarters than in the first half of the year. The final quarter is mostly the strongest in terms of sales as a greater number of projects enter the final billing stage at the end of the year. Service business grew substantially more quickly than new business in 2019, increasing by 7.7%to € 1,118.6million. Performance was disparate in the individual divisions; at Application Technol- ogy, the declining capacity utilization of many automotive paint shops resulted in weaker demand for spare parts.

Most service business is not included in the order backlog because of its short- term nature. However, factoring it into the order backlog, we are ­confident of achieving our sales target of € 3.9to 4.1billion in 2020. 1Ratio of order intake to sales 1 Selling, administrative and R&D expenses 3 Calculated on the basis of 69,202,080 shares since June 22, 2018 GROSS MARGIN DOWN Total costs (cost of sales, selling, administrative and R&D costs plus other operating expenses) grew by 2.2%in 2019and, hence, somewhat more quickly than sales, coming to € 3,748.3million. The cost 62 ANNUAL REPORT 2019 COMBINED MANAGEMENT REPORT Business report: Business performance of sales increased by 2.3%to € 3,083.3million. However, it should be borne in mind that this includes higher extraordinary expenses than in the previous year (2019: € 44.2million / 2018: € 30.7million). Gross operating profit was down in three out of five divisions. Against this backdrop, Group gross profit fell by€ 17.3million to SUBSTANTIAL RISE IN THE COST OF MATERIALS At € 1,681.4million, the cost of materials rose by 6.9%and, thus, more quickly than sales. Consequently, the cost of materials ratio widened by 2.2percentage points to 42.9%. This increase was due to the higher cost of externally sourced parts and the construction of buildings for system projects. The cost of materials is fully included in the cost of sales and chiefly comprises the cost of externally sourced parts as well as production and assembly services. Further information can be found in the chapter entitled ment\" page 32. Overhead costs rose by4.3%to€ 639.0million in2019. The largest cost block included in this figure is personnel expense, which was influenced by higher wages and salaries. The7.5%increase in selling expenses to€ 337.6million was chiefly caused by the acquisition of Megtec/Universal and higher trade exhibition expenses as well as ourbi-annual\"Open House\". We scaled back research and development expenses (down8.4%) after the sharp increases in previous years. However, there were no cuts to spending on important innovation sectors such as digitalization.

We had an annual average of 16,463employees. A large part of the 5.6%increase is due to the full-year consolidation of Megtec/­Universal, which has around 860employees. Personnel expense climbed by 8.5%to € 1,136.9million, reflecting not only higher wages and ­salaries but also the effects of the Megtec/Universal acquisition.

At € 263.1million, operating EBIT(EBITbefore extraordinary effects) was down only 4.3%on the previous year (€ 274.9million). The operating EBITmargin reached 6.7%(2018: 7.1%) thus exceeding the target range of 6.0to 6.5%that had been announced in July 2019. The low EBITin the fourth quarter of 2019(€ 41.8million) reflects the high extraordinary expenses of € 49.8million. Of this amount, INCREASE IN NET FINANCE EXPENSE Net finance expense increased to € 21.2million in 2019(2018: SUBSTANTIAL DECLINE IN EARNINGS AFTER TA XES Earnings before taxes decreased by 20.5%to € 174.7million due to higher extraordinary expenses (€ 67.2million) and higher net finance expense. Moreover, the growth in operating EBITin the Paint and Final Assembly Systems and Clean Technology Systems divisions was insufficient to absorb the decline in operating EBITin the Application Technology, Measuring and Process Systems and Woodworking Machinery and Systems divisions. 2.38EBIT BY QUARTER € million 100 80 86.2 80.2 72.2 67.7 60 60.9 58.9 51.1 50.3 51.9 48.6 46.6 41.8 40 20 0 Q1/19 Q1/18 Q1/17 Q2/19 Q2/18 Q2/17 Q3/19 Q3/18 Q3/17 Q4/19 Q4/18 Q4/17 64 ANNUAL REPORT 2019 COMBINED MANAGEMENT REPORT Business report: Business performance 2.39EBIT BEFORE EXTRAORDINARY EFFECTS BY QUARTER € million 100 91.6 93.0 80 69.2 72.0 77.3 66.8 67.6 64.6 60 56.8 54.6 52.3 56.0 40 20 0 Q1/19 Q1/18 Q1/17 Q2/19 Q2/18 Q2/17 Q3/19 Q3/18 Q3/17 Q4/19 Q4/18 Q4/17 2.40 -EXTRAORDINARY EFFECTS WITHIN EBIT € million 2019 2018 Paint and Final Assembly Systems -2.6 ȖȖPurchase price allocation -2.2 ȖȖPurchase price allocation expense expense ȖȖCapacity adjustment expense Application Technology -6.2 ȖȖPurchase price allocation -0.2 ȖȖPurchase price allocation expense expense ȖȖExpense for legal dispute Clean Technology Systems -11.2 ȖȖPurchase price allocation -20.1 ȖȖExpense from expense discontinuation­ of micro ȖȖTrailing expense from the gas turbine business Megtec/Universal acquisition ȖȖPurchase price allocation expense Measuring and Process Systems -1.6 ȖȖPurchase price allocation -1.5 ȖȖPurchase price allocation expense expense ȖȖExpense for closure of subsidiary­ in China (Shenlian) Woodworking Machinery and Systems -45.3 ȖȖPurchase price allocation -8.7 ȖȖPurchase price allocation expense expense ȖȖExpense of measures to ensure future viability/ optimization Corporate Center -0.3 ȖȖVarious minor special effects -8.7 ȖȖExpense of FOCUS 2.0 optimization­ program (Paint and Final Assembly Systems) ȖȖTransaction costs from the acquisition of Megtec/ Universal Total -67.2 -41.4 2017 -2.2ȖȖPurchase price allocation expense -0.5ȖȖExpense for realigning glueing technology (Wolfratshausen plant) ȖȖIncome from litigation ȖȖPurchase price allocation expense -0.7ȖȖPurchase price allocation expense -2.4ȖȖExpense for realigning filling technology (Agramkow) ȖȖPurchase price allocation expense -8.7ȖȖPurchase price allocation expense 17.7 ȖȖIncome from the sale of the Dürr Ecoclean Group ȖȖDiscontinuation of business at Dürr thermea GmbH 3.3 ANNUAL REPORT 2019 65 COMBINED MANAGEMENT REPORT Business report: Business performance 2.41EARNINGS AFTER TAX BY QUARTER € million 100 80 60 61.4 60.1 40.5 48.4 49.4 40 33.0 34.5 30.6 33.6 38.4 35.3 27.8 20 0 Q1/19 Q1/18 Q1/17 Q2/19 Q2/18 Q2/17 Q3/19 Q3/18 Q3/17 Q4/19 Q4/18 Q4/17 Tax expense contracted by € 11.3million to € 44.9million. In this connection, we benefited from the tax rate of 25.7%, which was roughly as low as it had been in the previous year. One reason for this was the recognition of unused tax losses of a subsidiary for the first time. In addition, we gained tax credits for R&D expenses abroad. Although earnings after taxes fell by 20.6%to € 129.8million (2018: € 163.5million), this marked the upper end of the target range of € 115to 130million that had been announced in November. The return on sales after taxes came to 3.3%, down from 4.2%in the ­previous year. Earnings per share dropped to € 1.79(2018: € 2.27). We will be proposing a dividend of € 0.80per share for 2019. This is equivalent to a reduction of 20.0%, which reflects the 20.6%decline in earnings after taxes. The dividend proposal translates into a total payout of € 55.4million and a payout ratio of 43%of earnings after taxes. This ratio exceeds our customary range of 30to 40%. The dividend proposal leaves Dürr AGwith a remaining net retained profit of € 514.5million (2018: € 508.4million), which is to be ­carried forward.

Several turnkey projects in North America contributed to this, while we also received major orders in India, South Africa and China. The greatest volume of new orders was obtained in the fourth quarter (€ 509.1million). North America accounted for the greatest proportion of order intake, closely followed by Europe. The Chinese market was tempo­ rarily more subdued, although we received several orders from e-mobilityOEMs there. Consequently, the share of new orders attributable to the emerging markets shrank from 63%to 47%. The margin quality of the orders received improved somewhat compared to 2018. With sales rising slightly by 0.7%to € 1,243.8million, the book-to-bill ratio reached 1.08. At 5.0%, the EBITmargin improved substantially, reaching the middle of the target range (4.6to 5.5%), underpinned by a 10.5%increase in EBITto € 61.9million. Whereas earnings in the first half of the year were impacted by old orders with lower margins, a positive trend emerged from the middle of the year, producing a wide EBITmargin of 6.9%in the fourth quarter. The division also benefited from the positive effects of the FOCUS 2.0optimization program. Capital expenditure in Paint and Final Assembly Systems increased substantially by € 15.2million to € 23.7million from the previous year's low figure. One reason for this was the new additions to right- of-use assets under leases, which were included in capital expenditure for the first time in accordance with IFRS 16. In addition, we invested in a new production plant and an office building at the Radom site in Poland. Capital employedpage 201by Paint and Final Assembly Systems rose significantly due to delayed customer payments.

Adjusted for all extraordinary expenses, the EBITmargin reached 10.7%, thus coming within the target corridor of 10.0to 11.0%.

By contrast, a restructuring-related loss of € 15.0million had arisen in the previous year. The integration of the Megtec/­Universal group has been largely completed and has progressed well. We consider the capital expenditure of € 3.7million to be a normal level after integration. Measuring and Process Systems Order intake in the Measuring and Process Systems division climbed by5.6%to€ 425.9million in2019, although performance in the fourth quarter was muted. By contrast, sales dropped by10.1%. One reason for this was the moderate order intake in the fourth quarter of2018, which was simultaneously characterized by extraordinarily­ high revenues. Business inbalancing technology page 200 for components of internal combustion engines (e.g. turbochargers and crankshafts) declined significantly but accounted for only around1%of total Group sales. The book-to-bill ratio stood at 1.04. In tandem with high R&D expenditure on digitalization, the substantial decline in sales caused EBITto contract by 35.4%to € 38.6million. At 9.4%, the EBITmargin did not quite reach the target corridor of 10.0to 11.0%. In the fourth quarter, which is traditionally the strongest period for Measuring and Process Systems, it came to a very good 12.4%for billing-related reasons. Capital expenditure in the Measuring and Process Systems division­ rose by € 11.5million to € 18.0million. This increase ­primarily reflects the application of IFRS 16, together with software investments. Woodworking Machinery and Systems Woodworking Machinery and Systems sustained a pronounced decline in demand in its business with the furniture industry in 2019. This particularly impacted system business with integrated production lines. The division's order intake dropped by 8.8%to in sales to 1.5%. The book-to-bill ratio of 0.95reflects the muted order intake. In response to the challenging market environment, structural overcapacities and process shortcomings, we announced a package of measures in the fourth quarter of 2019aimed at achieving sig- nificant efficiency improvements in WoodworkingMachinery­ and Systems. The division is thus continuing the optimization course adopted after the acquisition of the HOMAGGroup in 2014. These measures are to generate annual savings of around € 20million from 2021. Among other things, they include the ­discontinuation of production at the Hemmoor (Lower Saxony) site and other personnel adjustments. Roughly 350jobs will be cut by the end of 2020. Further components of the optimization package include process improvements, the reorganization of the HOMAGproduction system and the merger of the Systems and Automation business units. The package entails non-recurring expenses of € 40million, of which € 36.6million arose in the fourth quarter of 2019. A further HOMAGGroup, bringing the extraordinary effects for Woodworking Machinery and Systems to a total of € 45.3million in 2019. EBITdropped by 56.6%to € 37.4million primarily as a result of the extraordinary effects, translating into an EBITmargin of 2.9%, down from 6.6%in the previous year. Operating EBITfell by 12.8%. The main reasons for this were lower revenues, a changed sales mix as well as shortfalls in capacity utilization, high costs and partially inefficient processes. The operatingEBITmargin came to 6.5%, down from 7.3%in the previous year. At € 41.8million, capital expenditure was more or less unchanged and primarily concentrated on digital and ITprojects as well as productivity enhancement measures. The decline in capital employedpage 201was due to lower inventories, among other things. ANNUAL REPORT 2019 71 COMBINED MANAGEMENT REPORT Business report: Financial development Financial development FUNDING AND LIQUIDIT Y MANAGEMENT Our central finance and liquidity management is tasked with opti- mizing earnings and financing costs, mitigating financial risks and achieving transparency concerning the Group's funding and ­liquidity needs. The top priority of liquidity management is to always have an adequate volume of cash and cash equivalents available in order to be able to meet payment obligations at any time. The cash flow from our operating activities is the key source of funding. As a rule, debt finance is raised by Dürr AGand made available to the Group companies as required. Liquidity management is another task of Dürr AG. Its cash pooling system serves to consolidate all cash and cash equivalents of the Group, unless capital flows are restricted by the rules and regulations of individual states. In countries where this is the case (China and India, for example), our national companies largely obtain their funding locally. Group Treasury invests surplus funds in compliance with our financial asset management policy. At € 662.0million, cash and cash equivalents at the end of 2019slightly exceeded the previous year's level (€ 655.0million) and reached a share of total assets equivalent to 17.1%(December 31, 2018: 18.1%). Our net working capitalpage 201management is tasked with reinforcing the Group's internal funding capabilities and reducing the volume of capital employed.

FUNDING STRUCTURE OF THE DÜRR GROUP In 2019, we largely renewed our Group funding and partly linked the interest rates to the Dürr Group's sustainability performance. The two new, sustainability-oriented financing instruments are: Other components of our Group financing include the following: 72 ANNUAL REPORT 2019 COMBINED MANAGEMENT REPORT Business report: Financial development 2.49 -FINANCIAL LIABILITIES (DECEMBER 31) € million 2019 2018 2017 Bond/Schuldschein loans 798.2 598.0 597.3 Liabilities to banks 0.4 1.0 1.9 Leasing liabilities 107.1 7.2 5.8 Other interest-bearing liabilities 7.3 7.8 8.3 Interest deferral 10.1 9.3 9.4 Total 923.1 623.3 622.6 of which due within one year 38.0 12.5 12.7 The substantial increase in financial liabilities by 48.1%to RISING CASH FLOW 2.50 -CASH FLOWS € million 2019 2018 2017 Cash flow from operating activities 171.9 162.3 119.8 Cash flow from investing activities -231.8 -30.1 -17.2 Cash flow from financing activities 60.8 -134.0 -152.2 2.51 -CALCULATION OF CASH FLOW FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES AND FREE CASH FLOW¹ € million 2019 2018 2017 Earnings before income taxes 174.7 219.7 267.3 Depreciation and amortization 112.6 93.4 80.7 Interest result 27.6 20.9 21.6 Income tax payments -64.2 -93.0 -74.8 Change in provisions 18.8 -29.9 43.7 Change in net working capital -64.8 -51.6 -178.5 Other -32.7 2.7 -40.1 Cash flow from operating activities 171.9 162.3 119.8 Interest payments (net) -20.2 -12.0 -17.9 Repayment of leasing liabilities -27.4 0.0 0.0 Investment in property, plant and equipment and intangible assets -79.4 -71.9 -87.5 Free cash flow 44.9 78.4 14.3 Other cash flows -69.8 -222.4 3.3 Change in net financial status -24.9 -144.0 17.6 1 Exchange rate effects were eliminated in the cash flow statement.

Cash flow from operating activities improved by€ 9.6million in2019, to€ 171.9million. The increase innet working capital (NWC) page 201 turned out slightly higher, at€ 64.8million, than in the previous year (€ 51.6million). However, we recorded a far higherintra-yearNWCincrease, which we partly managed to offset in the fourth quarter: In comparison with September30,2019,NWCat year end declined by€ 146.1million; accordingly, in the final quarter we achieved high values in terms of operating cash flow (€ 233.2million) andfree cash flow page 201 (€ 203.0million).

Besides net working capital, cash flow was impacted by additions to provisions in the context of the optimization measures at Woodworking Machinery and Systems. Tax ­payments declined in 2019, whereas in the previous year higher tax payments were incurred as at the effective dates. Cash flow from investing activities amounted to €-231.8million in 2019(2018year: €-30.1million). The outflow of funds was chiefly attributable to the investment in term deposits amounting to as interest expenditure (included in the cash flow from ­financing activities) and reflects the sum total of funding freely available ­following all expenditure within a given period. The free cash flow shown in table 2.51reflects a change in net financial status of €-24.9million for 2019. A key item within other cash flows was the dividend payout of € 69.2million for 2018, which strongly influenced our 2.53 -NET FINANCIAL STATUS (DECEMBER 31) Cash flow from financing activities amounted to € 60.8million (2018: €-134.0million).

In 2019, EBITdecreased predominantly due to extraordinary effects, to € 195.9million (2018: € 233.5million). The EBITmargin, at 5.0%, was slightly higher than the target corridor of 4.4to 4.9%, which had been adjusted in November 2019.

That said, the figure of 16.9% represents­ a good value given the difficult situation in our markets. Moreover, we clearly managed to exceed our capital costs. 2.55 -VALUE ADDED We also determine non-financial performance indicators on a regular basis that assist us in management and the company's long-term strategic orientation. Examples are key figures on employee and customer satisfaction, further training, ecology/sustainability and R&D/innovation. While the non-financial performance indicators are becoming increasingly important, they do not primarily serve to control the company. Instead, they facilitate extended findings on the situation prevailing within the Group and decision-making on that basis. A detailed analysis of non-financial topics and performance indicators is available in the non-financial consolidated Capital employed (Dec. 31) ROCE NOPAT Weighted average cost of capital (WACC) EVA 2019 € million 1,160.6 % 16.9 € million 137.1 % 8.42 € million 39.4 2018 2017 971.9 738.9 76.0 142.7 declaration. The analysis of incoming orders and of the resulting sales enables us to engage in forward-looking capacity planning. As a rule, the realization of sales lags six to twelve months behind order intake. Incoming orders for 2019(€ 4,076.5million) reached the upper end of the target corridor (€ 3,800to € 4,100million), giving us a high degree of visibility as far as the realization of sales in 2020is ­concerned. The analysis of margins in order intake for 2019enables us to better estimate the earnings trend in 2020. ROCE(in %) is calculated as follows: EBIT 100 Capital employed Economic value added (EVA) reflects the value added that a company generates in a financial year. While we have managed to achieve a high level of value added since 2011, in 2019it turned out lower than in previous years. We determine the capital costs as the weighted average cost rate of equity and borrowing costs before taxes (weighted average cost of capital: WACC). In calculating the cost of equity, a beta factor is taken into account, derived from capital market data and the capital structure of peer group companies. ANNUAL REPORT 2019 75 COMBINED MANAGEMENT REPORT Business report: Financial development The borrowing costs comprise a basic interest rate for quasi-secure bonds and a surcharge determined from the credit rating of com­ parable peer group companies. In 2019, due to declining interest rates the cost of capital was lower than in the previous year. EVAis calculated as follows: EVA = NOPAT - (WACC capital employed) ȖȖNOPAT = Net Operating Profit After Taxes/EBIT after fictitious taxes ȖȖWACC = Weighted Average Cost of Capital The rule relating to the performance indicator ROCEpage 201is that added value is generated when the return on capital employed exceeds the costs of capital. In 2019, this was the case in four of five divisions. Paint and Final Assembly Systems, Application Technology and Measuring and Process Systems achieved ROCEof well over 10%. For Woodworking Machinery and Systems, ROCEexceeded the costs of capital slightly, although the result was impacted by extraordinary expenses on optimization measures. ROCEof Clean Technology Systems improved significantly, as expected; in 2020it is likely to grow even further and exceed the costs of capital. 2.56 -ROCE BY DIVISION % 2019 2018 2017 Paint and Final Assembly Systems 46.7 >100 >100 Application Technology 17.8 24.7 29.2 Clean Technology Systems 7.7 -9.7 5.5 Measuring and Process Systems 12.3 21.1 24.5 Woodworking Machinery and Systems 9.1 19.5 21.8 EQUIT Y EXCEEDS € 1 BILLION FOR THE FIRST TIME 2.57 -KEY BALANCE SHEET FIGURES 2019 2018 2017 Net financial status (Dec. 31) € million -99.3 32.3 176.3 Net financial liabilities in relation to EBITDA -0.3 - - Gearing (Dec. 31) % 8.7 -3.4 -24.3 Net working capital (NWC) (Dec. 31) € million 502.7 441.4 373.7 Days working capital days 46.1 41.1 36.2 Inventory turnover days 46.7 49.8 44.4 Days sales outstanding days 53.8 56.1 51.7 Equity assets ratio (Dec. 31) % 78.9 79.7 81.1 Asset coverage (Dec. 31) % 158.8 142.9 152.0 Asset intensity (Dec. 31) % 34.1 34.4 31.6 Current assets to total assets (Dec. 31) % 65.9 65.6 68.4 Degree of asset depreciation % 41.4 38.5 36.1 Depreciation expense ratio % 6.1 6.4 6.5 Cash ratio (Dec. 31) % 37.1 35.7 36.2 Quick ratio (Dec. 31) % 69.1 66.5 64.8 Equity ratio (Dec.31) % 26.9 27.4 25.6 Total assets (Dec. 31) € million 3,882.3 3,614.4 3,511.6 Total assets at the end of 2019increased by € 267.9million (up 7.4%), to € 3,882.3million.

Similarly, the difference between fair values and book ­values is also low. Property, plant and equipment may develop hidden reserves, especially in the case of land and buildings. Schenck Technologie- und Industriepark GmbH (TIP) in Darm- stadt is ­worthy of mention in this regard. According to our assess- ment, its fair value exceeds the book value by a sum in the double-­ digit ­million euro range. In total, the fair values exceed the book values on the liabilities side of the balance sheet by approx. 0.7%of total assets. Further particulars in this regard are listed in item 35of the notes to the consolidated financial statements. INVESTMENTS IMPACTED BY IFRS 16 Investments (excluding acquisitions) amounted to € 102.6million in 2019. The 37.9%increase year-on-year was almost fully attributable to the application of IFRS 16, which required additions to right-of-use assets under leases to be reported under investments for the first time.

ANNUAL REPORT 2019 79 COMBINED MANAGEMENT REPORT Events subsequent to the reporting date EVENTS SUBSEQUENT TO THE REPORTING DATE The corona epidemic initially impacted economic activities above all in China. Since the beginning of March, however, the crisis has also been increasingly spreading to Europe and America. As things currently stand, it seems possible for us to make up for a large part of the corona-related declines incurred so far in the further course of the year. For fiscal 2020, no material impacts on the assets, financial position and results of operations of the Dürr Group are expected at this time. However, the economic risks resulting from the corona crisis have increased significantly in recent weeks. At the end of his employment contract on February 29, 2020, CFOCarlo Crosetto left the company at his own request. With the approval of the Supervisory Board, in February 2020the Board of Management adopted a resolution to redeem and refinance the variable tranches (€ 100million) of the Schuldschein loan issued in 2016prematurely in April 2020in order to further optimize the Group financing arrangement with regard to interest expenses and terms to maturity. From the beginning of the current financial year to March 18, 2020, no further events occurred that materially affected, or could ­materially affect, the net assets, financial position and results of operations of the Group. 80 ANNUAL REPORT 2019 COMBINED MANAGEMENT REPORT Report on risks, opportunities and expected future development: Risks REPORT ON RISKS, OPPORTUNITIES AND EXPECTED­ FUTURE DEVELOPMENT Risks We follow the strategy of managing the risks associated with our entrepreneurial actions in such a manner that the opportunities prevail. To this end, we make use of an effective risk management system. RISK MANAGEMENT SYSTEM OF THE DÜRR GROUP Scope of application Our risk management system is deployed throughout the Group. It has existed in its fundamental structure since 2008and has since been continually adapted to new requirements. In 2019it essentially remained unchanged. However, in 2019we assessed our compliance risks for the very first time; these had not previously been quantified. The companies Megtec and Universal, acquired in October 2018, were included in the Dürr Group's risk management ­system for the full year 2019. Objectives Our risk management system is especially tailored to the mechanical and plant engineering business. In this way, we are able to record, analyze and - to the extent possible - evaluate risks system­ atically and uniformly. This allows effective countermeasures to be initiated at an early stage. We document all specific risks to the extent that these are identifiable and concrete to an adequate degree. Non-quantifiable strategic risks as well as general risks with a low level of probability of occurring, such as natural disasters, are not taken into account. We also document and evaluate our oppor- tunities; the relevant information is contained in the \"Opportunities report\" page 90. Methods and processes The risk management system covers all essential business and ­decision-making processes. We maintain open dealings with risks and encourage employees to report any misdirected developments at an early stage. The risk management process takes account of all risks of the participating companies. The central risk management team at Dürr AGinitiates the nine-stage process every six months. The centerpiece of this standard risk cycle is the risk inventory of the Group's companies. In the process, individual risks are iden- tified, evaluated and consolidated, i.e. classified into 15specific risk fields (chart 2.66). The risk fields cover management, core and ­support processes as well as external risk areas. The risk managers of the operating units and Dürr AGare responsible for evaluating individual risks. They use the risk management manual as well as risk structure spreadsheets to do so. The evaluation process consists of three stages: First of all, the damage potential is calculated, i.e. the maximum impact on EBITthat can result from a risk in the following 24months. Next, we assess the likelihood of specific risk scenarios turning into reality. In a third step, the effectiveness of possible countermeasures is examined and evaluated with a risk-reducing factor. The bottom line is the net risk potential, i.e. the net EBITrisk that remains after taking into account the probability of occurrence and the effectiveness of suitable countermeasures. The lower the probability of occurrence and the higher the effectiveness of counter- measures, the more sharply the net EBITrisk declines. The net EBITrisks of the 15risk fields are calculated from the sum total of net EBITrisks of all individual risks assigned. Depending on the extent of its net EBITrisk, each risk field is assigned to one of the following categories: The net EBITrisks of all risk fields are totaled to produce the Group's entire potential risk exposure. Portfolio and correlation effects are not taken into consideration in this process. ANNUAL REPORT 2019 81 COMBINED MANAGEMENT REPORT Report on risks, opportunities and expected future development: Risks The Group companies and divisions prepare their risk reports after the risk inventory has been completed. These reports constitute the basis for the Group risk report of Dürr AG, containing information on individual risks and overall risk. Following an analysis by the Board of Management and the Dürr Management Board, the Group risk report is forwarded to the Supervisory Board and then initially discussed at length by the Audit Committee. Next, the Audit Committee Chairman presents a statement to the Supervisory Board. Acute risks are reported without delay to the Board of Management and the heads of the relevant divisions. The risk managers of the Group, divisions and Group companies are responsible for the process of identifying, evaluating, controlling and monitoring risks as well as for reporting; in most cases, these are the heads of the Controlling departments. The Internal Auditing department is also involved and verifies compliance with the defined processes on a regular basis. 2.66 -RISK FIELDS OF THE DÜRR GROUP RISKS IN RELATION TO MATERIAL NFD NON-FINANCIAL MATTERS Due to the CSRDirective Implementation Act, our risk management system also takes into account risks that may arise from our business activities in general or specifically from our products and services and may have impacts on non-financial issues that we classify as material within the meaning of the CSRDirective Implementation Act. Essentially, a negative influence on material non-­ financial issues cannot be ruled out. However, we do not perceive any risks that could very probably lead to serious negative impacts. KEY FEATURES OF THE INTERNAL CONTROL SYSTEM/RISK MANAGEMENT SYSTEM FOR THE ACCOUNTING PROCESS The internal control system (ICS) and the risk management system (RMS) for the accounting process are elements of the Dürr Group's risk management system. It comprises all rules, measures and ­processes that guarantee the reliability of financial reporting to an adequate degree of certainty, and ensure that the financial statements of the Group and its companies are prepared in conformity External risk areas Competition Market Taxes, Economic Society/­ legislation, environment/ environment compliance capital market Management Management process Core process Sales/bid phase Project execution/ After-sales phase engineering Support processes Research & Procurement Manu­ Finance/­ Human IT development facturing controlling resources 82 ANNUAL REPORT 2019 COMBINED MANAGEMENT REPORT Report on risks, opportunities and expected future development: Risks with the IFRS. The Board of Management bears the overall responsibility for ICS/RMSand has set up an appropriate managerial and reporting organization to this end, covering all organizational and legal units of the Group. Monitoring of the ICS/RMSis the task of the Internal Auditing department. The internal control system takes account of the specific features of Group accounting. The key instruments as well as control and backup routines for the accounting process are as follows: In order to avoid risks and ensure unobjectionable financial state- ments, we deal carefully with key regulations and new developments in the field of accounting and reporting. Particular weight is assigned to accounting for customer orders for which revenue ­recognition over time is applied, the impairment test of goodwill, the reliability of qualitative statements in the management report and in the corporate governance report, as well as the implementation of new IFRSparameters such as IFRS 16\"Leases\" in the financial year 2019. Within the scope of the ICS/RMS, we provide regular training ­sessions for employees of our finance departments, for instance in the application of accounting standards, accounting rules as well as ITsystems. In the case of corporate acquisitions, we adjust the accounting processes without delay and familiarize new employees with all the relevant processes, content and systems. OVER ALL RISK SITUATION The overall risk potential at the end of 2019amounted to approx. ANNUAL REPORT 2019 83 COMBINED MANAGEMENT REPORT Report on risks, opportunities and expected future development: Risks in the \"Economic environment/capital market\" field saw a sharp rise due to trade conflicts, geopolitical uncertainties and declining cyclical­ activity. As in the previous year, this was the key risk field, followed by \"Finance/controlling\", \"Taxes/legislation/com- pliance\", \"Market\"­ and \"Project execution/engineering\". The net risk potentials of 259evaluated individual risks were included in the overall risk potential. The increased overall risk potential reflects the more difficult framework conditions of our business and is being carefully analyzed. Nevertheless, we do not assess this as alarming but, as in the past, we consider it controlla- ble. Risks that might endanger the Group's continued existence as a going concern, whether separately or in combination with other risks, are not discernible from today's perspective. 2.67 -RISK FIELDS AND NET RISKS Net risk Low Medium (> € 5 (> € 20 High Very low million to million to (≤ € 5 ≤ € 20 ≤ € 40 (> € 40 Risk field million) million) million) million) Economic environment/ capital market Sales/bid phase Project execution/­ engineering Taxes, legislation, compliance Market Research & development Competition Procurement Human resources IT Manufacturing Society/environment After-sales phase Finance/controlling Management process RISK FIELDS AND SIGNIFICANT INDIVIDUAL RISKS Economic environment The risks arising from the economic environment increased yet again substantially in 2019. Trade disputes, unilateralism and political conflicts as well as a high level of public debt and the problems surrounding Brexit are a collective burden on economic development and global trade. This results in declining consumer confi- dence, lower demand for investment goods and growing uncertainty within corporate entities. The deterioration in economic framework conditions had varying impacts on the Dürr Group. While demand in the furniture industry declined by around 9%in 2019, we managed to boost the level of incoming orders from the automotive industry by close to 3%, even though this industry segment registered declining sales and is undergoing a process of deep-seated structural change. In this context, we benefited from new customers and growing demand in the field of production technology for electric vehicles. We are not directly impacted by international trade conflicts since no punitive tariffs were imposed on our products. In China, our biggest individual market, economic growth in 2020is likely to turn out lower year-on-year due to the corona epidemic. The extent to which the epidemic will be damaging the economy in China and globally cannot, however, be reliably estimated at this time. In addition, please refer to the statements in the \"Report on expected future development\"page 92on the consequences of the corona epidemic. The trade dispute with the United States has led to consumer reluctance to buy in China, which applies to both the automotive sector and the furniture industry­. Nevertheless, there is medium- to long-term growth potential for both industry sectors in China, since market saturation is far from being reached, amid rising per-capita incomes. If an economic slump were to occur in China, this would substantially impair the Dürr Group's sales and earnings. Possible risks due to Brexit include trade impediments, investment declines and exchange rate distortions. The immediate impacts on our business are likely to be manageable since the United Kingdom only accounts for just under 3%of our sales and 1%of our assets. We can bridge cyclical weaknesses relatively well in smaller-scale markets since the distribution of our business is balanced on an international level. Cyclical fluctuations are discernible at a comparatively late stage within the Dürr Group since our plant engineering 84 ANNUAL REPORT 2019 COMBINED MANAGEMENT REPORT Report on risks, opportunities and expected future development: Risks business is shaped by long-term investment decisions of the automotive industry. In the early-cycle mechanical engineering busi- ness, macroeconomic changes tend to take effect faster. Capital market Economic crises and political conflicts may shock the capital ­markets, make new financing transactions more expensive and restrict credit availability. On the other hand, this is alleviated by the European Central Bank's policy of low interest rates, which enabled us to refinance at more favorable terms in the summer of 2019than before. We classify the risk of a hostile takeover of Dürr AGas relatively low since the Dürr family owns 29.1%of the company's shares. In line with the domination and profit and loss transfer agreement with HOMAGGroup AG, external shareholders of HOMAGGroup AGreceive a guaranteed dividend of € 1.01; in addition, we have made them a cash compensation offer amounting to € 31.56per share. External shareholders of HOMAGGroup AGhave valuation proceedings underway to have the extent of the guaranteed dividend and cash compensation appraised by a court of law. According to a ­ruling handed down by the Regional Court of Stuttgart in August 2019, the cash compensation was to be raised to € 31.58and the guaranteed dividend to € 1.03per share. The ruling is not final and binding as yet since shareholders of HOMAGGroup AGfiled an appeal in October 2019. If the Higher Regional Court of Stuttgart, the court of second instance, holds higher contributions to be appropriate, this would give rise to additional expenditure. It cannot be ruled out altogether that information of a confidential nature or of relevance to the capital market will be prematurely leaked outside the organization. We protect ourselves from this by keeping the number of persons with access to such information small and by instructing the relevant persons with regard to their duties. In addition, we set up project-related insider lists and use secure communication technologies. Operating risks: sales/bid phase One risk during the bid phase is that we may not be able to assert margin targets in contract award negotiations in a phase of high competitive intensity. When performing order calculations, there is potential for incorrect cost assessments. To prevent this, we always obtain current market prices on the procurement side and have our calculation assumptions reviewed internally. Woodworking­ Machinery and Systems has limited contact with end customers in China as sales activities take place via a partner company in which the HOMAGGroup has a minority equity interest. At present, how- ever, we are planning to acquire this partner company in full. Operating risks: project execution/engineering The key risk to bear in mind during project execution is any ­failure to meet deadlines or other commitments. This can lead to additional expenses or to customer payments being postponed. Although project­ lifetimes currently tend to grow shorter, we assess this risk as controllable since our capacities are adjusted to match our ­volume of business. Especially in the paint shop business, thanks to largely standardized products and professional processes we are able to handle numerous large projects safely in parallel. Operating risks: after-sales phase The spare parts business depends on capacity utilization of our cus- tomers' plants, among other factors. If the level of capacity utilization decreases, then the level of demand for spare parts usually­ declines. In 2019, this was felt particularly in the Application Technol­ogy division. However, the division managed to compensate for the impacts on earnings sustained through the declining spare parts business by the positive trend in new business. In addi- tion, demand for spare parts increased again in the fourth quarter. A further risk in the spare parts business is that inventories in stock may age and need to be written off. Taxes, legislation, compliance and compliance management system The risk potential in the risk field \"Taxes/legislation/compliance\" has risen significantly as we assessed the compliance risks for the first time. No extraordinary legal disputes are pending at present. We must observe different national legal norms. To avoid viola- tions, we cooperate with local legal experts and train our employees­ accordingly. New trade barriers and legislation may increase our costs and reduce our sales opportunities. Changes under tax law may lead to higher tax payments and affect our tax assets and ­liabilities; in addition, there is the risk of uncertainties in interpreting the underlying tax legislation. In large system projects, tax and customs risks may occur in cases of complex international delivery­ processes. As a rule, material legal risks arise from warranty claims, claims for damages in cases of production failures or patent litigation. If we fail to meet our contractual obligations in performing our services, we may be liable to penalties. Before making any contractual representations and warranties, we study what liability-related consequences we may face. As a principle, we rule out any commitments that we cannot fulfill. In most cases, contractual risks in project business are higher than in single machine business. Following our entry into the IIoT businesspage 200,new risks under VATlaw ANNUAL REPORT 2019 85 COMBINED MANAGEMENT REPORT Report on risks, opportunities and expected future development: Risks as well as risks relating to violation of third parties' intellectual ­property rights have additionally emerged. Compliance violations, for instance in the field of competition or product liability law, may lead to criminal prosecution, liability risks and image loss. We are not aware of any serious violations at this time. We protect ourselves by means of a compliance manage­ ment system, the basic features of which are described at www. durr-group.com in the section on Investors/Corporate Gover- nance. The system is monitored on a regular basis and comprises all activities with the objective of ensuring that all employees in daily operations behave in conformity with the relevant rules and ethical requirements. It governs the responsibilities, communication channels and measures in three central fields of activity synchronized with one another: preventing, detecting promptly, and responding to compliance violations. In this way, the compliance management system supports employees in preventing contraventions and associated risks of liability and criminal convictions. In addition, we deal with corruption risks in a targeted manner. Key instruments are internal policies, online training sessions, the four-eye principle and the work carried out by the Internal ­Auditing department. Market Considering the huge investment demand in such segments as electromobility, autonomous driving and connectivity, the automotive industry might reduce production technology investments of relevance to us. At present, however, we continue to register a comfortable to high level of investments, and in2019our incoming orders in the automotive business were up by around3%. One of the ­reasons for this is that carmakers need high cash flows from business with conventional vehicles in order to develop new technolo- gies. This presupposes that they will continue to invest adequately inefficiency-­enhancingproduction technology. Another factor is that the trend towarde-mobilityand increased localization of automotive production in the wake of the trade conflicts is opening up new business opportunities for us; the relevant information is listed in the\"Opportunities report\" page 90. In the automotive business, we cannot rule out dependency risks as only a small number of carmakers exist worldwide. That said, their number has grown most recently since new producers of electrically powered vehicles have entered the market. In 2019, 30%of our sales were generated by business with the ten largest customers (2018: 32%). Outside the automotive industry, the dependency risks are considerably lower as our customer base is very broad. In our markets, we are confronted by price pressure; as a rule, this is most pronounced in paint shop construction for the automotive industry. We respond to price pressure with innovation, process optimization, localization and cost control. In our business with the automotive industry there is a risk of customers asserting payment terms that are unfavorable to us. The general willingness to make substantial prepayments for large projects has declined in the industry in the past two to three years. Chinese customers in particular prefer acceptance drafts - a kind of bill of exchange - to conventional prepayments. In projects of this kind, payments by customers also tend to be made later or less evenly across the project duration. Defaults in payment have not increased, and uncollectible claims are extremely rare in business with the automotive industry. For projects with new producers of electric cars, we avoid credit ­rating risks by conducting a thorough solvency check in advance. We carefully monitor receivables from customers without an investment grade rating. We do not perceive any concrete risks to our market leadership at present. New products and business models that could endanger our position are not discernible in our markets. Disruptive technologies such as electromobility have not led to lower demand for painting, assembly and testing technologypage 200.Instead, the level of demand for final assembly technology is likely to rise since the assembly of electric cars partly calls for new methods to be deployed. In the field of painting technology, there are no serious­ substitution risks as there are still no alternatives to aluminum, steel and plastics in large-scale serial car body production. Com­ posite materials deployed in lightweightpage 200construction also need to be painted by conventional means. Wood and chipboard continue to dominate in furniture production; for this reason,­ the HOMAGGroup is not exposed to any major substitution risks. In the course of digitalization, we need to offer our customers top-performing software and ITsolutions. Otherwise, competitors from the software industry could come between us and our customers with offers of their own. Thanks to ADAMOSand other software and smart products, however, we are well placed to defend our ­market position. Moreover, we know our customers' production processes very well. 86 ANNUAL REPORT 2019 COMBINED MANAGEMENT REPORT Report on risks, opportunities and expected future development: Risks Corporate strategic risks in the emerging markets The high business share in the emerging markets (45%of sales) entails specific risks: Strategy risks: acquisitions/new fields of activity As regards corporate acquisitions, sales, earnings and synergies may turn out lower than planned. We hedge this risk by means of due diligence audits and integration plans. When entering into new fields of business, misguided estimates of resources deployed, ­customer requirements and price targets, as well as the development of demand, markets and competition cannot be ruled out. Moreover, problems may arise in the field of technology develop- ment. Such misguided estimates and problems may increase the risk of impairment on investments, goodwill, book values of equity interests and capitalized development costs. R&D and product liability risks With regard to innovations, there is a risk that we may not be able to adequately absorb our development costs through our product prices. Technical problems may also occur in the development of new products, resulting in delays or additional costs. To avoid ­market acceptance risks, we analyze demand accurately, engage pilot customers in our projects and develop products with a high return on investment. This also reduces the risk of impairment charges on capitalized development costs. We review the patent­ situation­ to ensure that no products violate any intellectual ­property rights of third parties. To prevent product liability cases, we ensure that our products meet health and safety regulations, and we take out appropriate insurance policies. Competition In view of our extensive market share, some customers choose to cooperate with smaller-sized competitors. This may make our price targets difficult to achieve. Local competitors sometimes undercut our prices. We counter this by increasing value added locally and by protecting our technology lead through innovations. In the paint shop business, our competitor Automotive Engineer- ing, a subsidiary of the Chinese Sinomach Group, plans to take over the insolvent German competitor Eisenmann. We do not expect this transaction to result in a marked change in the competitive situation. We are not aware of any rival products that could endanger our ­market position. In certain markets, we have registered an above-­ average level of competitive intensity. We have noticed that competitors from the emerging markets are also starting to operate outside their home markets. Procurement and manufacturing The risk of a lack of supplier availability, which particularly impacted Woodworking and Machinery Systems in 2018, declined in 2019. This is also due to a lower level of demand. To mitigate availability and price risks, we enter into framework agreements with preferred suppliers and pool our procurement volumes. Dependency risks may occur in a few cases; we reduce these by broadening our supplier base. For standard bought-in parts, a change in suppliers may make it necessary for us to change constructions and contend with corresponding cost increases. At some production sites, fluctuations in orders placed may lead to low capacity utiliza- tion. Inventory risks are possible in particular when model changes occur within the product program. We select and monitor suppliers carefully as a precaution against quality deficiencies or delayed deadlines, which may occur particularly among suppliers in the emerging markets. Moreover, we have ANNUAL REPORT 2019 87 COMBINED MANAGEMENT REPORT Report on risks, opportunities and expected future development: Risks reduced our dependency on suppliers in some divisions by extending our own production activities. We are often unable to pass rising­ supplier prices on to our customers in full. The insolvency risk of suppliers is low in most countries. Human resources We hire external workers to avoid risks of capacity bottlenecks. As we have numerous highly qualified employees, know-how losses may be incurred when they leave our company. This is why we distribute specialist expertise across a number of persons and ­promote knowledge transfer by documentation and training measures. Bottlenecks­ in personnel procurement are possible especially in the fields of information technology, digitalization and electrical engineering. To counteract this, we rely on long-term career planning for experts, intensified personnel and university marketing as well as vocational training and cooperative state university courses. ­Salary hikes during the lifetime of large, long-term projects can result in an additional cost factor; this risk exists above all in the emerging markets. We cannot rule out violations of labor law and tariff-based arrangements either. We have outsourced pension commitments to external pension funds in which other enterprises also participate. Should one of these companies file for insolvency, this would give rise to the risk of co-liability for its retirement benefit commitments. Accordingly, we regularly monitor the financing status of the pension funds and the performance of the participating companies. Our pension risks are manageable. The discount rate used for calculating pension obligations in Germany amounted to 0.7%as at December 31, 2019, and thus turned out lower than on the pre­ vious year's reference date (1.7%). Pension provisions amounted to € 59.0million. IT and management processes ITrisks, such as data loss, hacking and virus attacks or availability shortfalls, are increasing in the wake of ongoing digitalization. We protect ourselves by means of a Group-wideITsecurity organization and a robust ITinfrastructure equipped with state-of-the-art firewalls and antivirus programs. We use back-up servers, redundant data lines and uninterrupted power supply units to avoid any outages. We rate the risk of hacker attacks and data theft as normal for the industry in which we operate. Cybercrime fraud attempts by computer and data manipulations are no rarity. To avoid loss or damage, we use enhanced authentication standards in electronic payments, security certificates for email messages, secure smartphones and verified bank connec- tions. In addition, we regularly draw our employees' attention to typical fraud practices. Incorrect assignment of ITaccess privileges gives rise to the risk of data being read or manipulated by unauthorized persons. We protect ourselves by restrictive assignment of privileges. Reading and editing rights regarding sensitive data are assigned only to ­employees who absolutely depend on them to perform their work. The EUGeneral Data Protection Regulation, in force since 2018, has tightened the requirements for processing personal data. In order to lower the risk of violations, we have informed our employees of the rules and regulations and prepared instructions for action. Environment, health and safety We counter the risk of accidents at work by carrying out regular safety instruction, compulsory online training and comprehensive safety standards and procedures described in our health & safety policy. In addition, we cooperate with our customers in order to guarantee occupational safety on construction sites. To comply ­reliably with environmental conditions imposed, we have appointed environmental protection officers; we also rely on environmental­ management certifications and policies. Substances that are harmful to health or the environment are only used to a limited­ extent. CURRENCY, INTEREST AND LIQUIDIT Y RISKS AS WELL AS FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS FOR RISK MITIGATION PURPOSES An exact description of currency, interest rate and liquidity risks is provided in the notes to the consolidated financial statements (item 41).A Group policy applies to the task of managing these risks. The top corporate body in this area is the Financial Risk ­Committee consisting of the CFO, the heads of Group Controlling and Group Treasury as well as the financial officers of the divisions. This body discusses strategic financial policy issues and prepares resolutions for the Board of Management. Hedging currency risks We use financial derivatives for hedging purposes. In most cases these are forward exchange contracts used as currency hedges. Their nominal value came to € 480.9million at the end of 2019(December 31, 2018: € 488.1million). In particular, payment flows were hedged in the key currencies listed under item 41of the notes to the consolidated financial statements. The use of financial 88 ANNUAL REPORT 2019 COMBINED MANAGEMENT REPORT Report on risks, opportunities and expected future development: Risks derivatives can entail risks, such as less favorable deposit conditions and higher financing costs. Moreover, the market value of financial derivatives may decrease if credit risk spreads increase due to changes on the financial markets. In most cases, we hedge foreign currency risks of orders placed immediately after the relevant contract awards. In principle, we agree a separate (micro) hedge for each larger individual project. In the standard machinery and spare parts business, we also use macro-hedges for any number of orders bundled. All financial derivatives and their underlying transactions are checked and valued on a regular basis. Financial derivatives are exclusively used to hedge loans and operations in commercial terms. The risks involved in currency translation into euros saw a further increase in 2019. Our export-related transaction risks are relatively moderate as we produce numerous products locally or purchase them in local currency. Hedging interest rate risks We pursue a conservative interest rate and financing strategy comprising three core elements: long-term interest rate and financing certainty, matching maturities and a prohibition of speculation. Our financial debt primarily comprises the Schuldschein loans of the years 2019and 2016, the bond placed in 2014and the leasing liabilities required to be reported as financial liabilities since 2019in accordance with IFRS 16. The risk of interest rate fluctuations of our Group financing arrangement is limited. For the purpose of hedging the interest rates for the variable tranches of the Schuldschein loan issued in 2016, a volume of financial derivatives amounting to Interest rate risk management covers all interest-bearing and interest-sensitive balance sheet line items. Regular interest rate analyses enable risks to be identified at an early stage. Group Treasury is chiefly responsible for borrowing, investment and interest rate hedges; from a defined scale upward, exceptions must be submitted to the CFOfor approval. Hedging liquidity risks We largely cover our liquidity needs from our cash flow. At times of temporary negative cash flows, we are able to use cash and cash equivalents and the cash line of the syndicated loan. This was not necessary in 2019. Please also refer to the chapter on \"Financial development\"page 72in this regard. Our cash pooling enables us to make use of liquidity surpluses of individual companies for other Group subsidiaries, provided that the capital transfer regulations of the individual states allow this practice. This enables us to avoid taking out loans and paying interest expenditure. Financing risks No risks relating to borrowing exist at this time. The terms of our corporate bond contain the usual restrictions and obligations. A violation could result in the bond amount plus accrued interest being called due for immediate payment. The two Schuldschein loans may also be called for immediate repayment in the event of a violation of material contractual obligations, in case of insolvency or a change of control. The agreement on our syndicated loan, redeemed in August, contained a financial covenant that obliged us to observe a certain key financial ratio. In 2019, this covenant was complied with on every effective calculation date until the loan was redeemed. For the new syndicated loan it is no longer applicable. Hedging investment risks Our policy for financial asset management governs how to deal with investment risks and defines the permissible asset classes and credit status requirements. As we do not hold any government or corporate bonds, we are not subject to corresponding repayment and impairment risks. R ATINGS We do not have any ratings carried out to assess our credit status. ANNUAL REPORT 2019 89 COMBINED MANAGEMENT REPORT Report on risks, opportunities and expected future development: Opportunities Opportunities OPPORTUNITIES MANAGEMENT SYSTEM We identify and evaluate new business opportunities with the help of a Group-wide opportunity management system. This is ­primarily done by the divisions, which collect information on new trends and market requirements through their contacts with cus- tomers, suppliers and partners. This information is aggregated to identify­ opportunity clusters, and duly evaluated. Opportunity clusters offering sustained economic potential are analyzed by the Board of Management and the division heads as part of the strategy process. The divisions then integrate the approved opportunity ­clusters in their strategy and define goals, measures, responsibilities and schedules. Identifying and evaluating business opportunities is an ongoing process, which is coordinated by the division heads. The Board of Management and the Corporate Development department are responsible at the level of Dürr AG. If opportunities are found to be of major strategic significance, we form multidisciplinary teams to conduct potential analyses and establish the budget. Joint activities with universities, research institutes and the Dürr Technology Council also from part of opportunity management. These contacts help us to determine the extent to which new ­scientific findings may yield opportunities for the Dürr Group. Opportunities may also arise from new legislation, e.g. on emission protection and international trade. Our opportunities management system takes account of global and regional business opportunities as well as the potential offered by specific products, customers and business models. POTENTIAL OFFERED BY OPPORTUNITIES This section now proceeds to describe the material opportunities of the Group and the divisions. The business plan for 2020and the strategic plan through 2023incorporate the sales and earnings potential that can realistically be expected to be generated by these opportunities. If we are able to make use of the opportunities to a greater extent than assumed, sales and EBITmay exceed the ­figures budgeted for 2020by up to 4%and 26%, respectively. How- ever, this additional sales and EBITpotential is achievable only in a best-case scenario. STR ATEGIC OPPORTUNITIES Digitalization/Industrial Internet of Things: Digitalization is creating new business opportunities. Examples include sales growth in the software segment and the establishment of new business and pricing models that are based, for example, on the value of a digital service for system availability, the intensity of use or the number of connected machines. In addition, digitalization allows us to stand apart from our peers. Sustainability: We are benefiting from the trend toward low-­ consumption and energy-efficient production systems. Many of our customers are attaching increasing importance to sustainability­ and want to produce on a carbon-neutral basis in the foreseeable future. As a supplier of production technology, we can contribute to this goal by offering low-consumption solutions. Growth in automotive production: According to experts, automotive production is set to increase by an annual average of 2.5%between 2019and 2026. This corresponds to a total of a good 17million additional units, for the production of which the automotive industry requires corresponding capacities. Above-­average growth is projected in the emerging markets, where we have a strong footprint. Electromobility: Electromobility offers opportunities for the Dürr Group. For one thing, new producers of electric vehicles are entering the market, something which is broadening our customer base. For another, we expect the automotive incumbents to significantly step up plant conversion spending and investments in special ­production technologies for EVs. Automation: Our customers are increasingly demanding automated manufacturing processes with a view to improving quality and lowering operating costs. We benefit from this with our extensive automation competence. Service: Our production technology is used in numerous factories worldwide. This broad installed base offers growth opportunities for us in service business with its higher margins. We intend to tap this potential within the framework of the life cycle services strategy field. 90 ANNUAL REPORT 2019 COMBINED MANAGEMENT REPORT Report on risks, opportunities and expected future development: Opportunities Process excellence: The quality and efficiency of our processes form a key thrust of our new mid-term strategy. Through metho­ dical and structural process optimization, we want to harness potential for optimizing costs and earnings. This is what the ­efficiency strategy field stands for. Localization/local products: By expanding our local capacities in key markets, we are improving cost structures and customer ­proximity. Localizing product development allows us to take better­ account of regional market requirements. Southeast Asia: Driven by rising per-capita income, Southeast Asia is an attractive growth market in which we will be broadening our footprint. In local automotive business, we intend to intensify our relations with the Japanese automotive industry, which holds a strong market position in Southeast Asia. OPPORTUNITIES IN THE DIVISIONS Paint and Final Assembly Systems has completed the FOCUS 2.0optimization program. Consequently, the EBITmargin should continue to widen and probably reach the target range of 6to 7%in 2021. The e-mobility transformation offers opportunities in painting and final assembly technology. Business in final assembly technology should benefit from the consolidation of all related activities­ under the umbrella of Paint and Final Assembly Systems. The innovative \"Paint Shop of the Future\" concept is expected to generate­ impe­- tus for growth in paint shop technology. It replaces the ­previous­ line production with several flexible painting boxes and automated guided vehicles, and it also enables rapid plant expansion in accordance with requirements. Application Technology is benefiting from various current trends: The division's robot and software solutions are supporting the automation and flexibilization of painting lines. With the EcoPaintJet robot system for two-tone painting, Application Technology has a disruptive technology that offers customers new possibilities for product customization. There are also growth opportunities in business with general industry, in glueing technologypage 200and with application technology solutions for insulating and glueing battery cells for electric vehicles. Clean Technology Systems possesses further growth potential through the acquisition of Megtec/Universal. Earnings are expected to rise through a focus on attractive market segments and the harnessing of further economies of scale as a result of the acquisition. More stringent emission limits in emerging markets such as China are feeding demand for environmental technology equipment. The division can benefit from the trend toward electro­ mobility with systems for double-sided coating of electrodes for lithium-ion batteries. Measuring and Process Systems sees increasing opportunities with balancing technologypage 200and spin test systems for e-mobility components. There is also growth potential in the airlines business segment (balancing technology for aircraft turbines). In addition, the division is benefiting from the increasing automation of the balancing process and the need for greater precision in view of lower tolerances in measuring and correcting unbalance. Japanese business is to gain new impetus from closer cooperation with the joint venture partner Nagahama Seisakusho. Woodworking Machinery and Systems is intensifying the optimization­course that it has adopted in order to harness further efficiency gains. Important measures include the roll-out of the new production system, ITharmonization and the improvement of internal interfaces. In conjunction with the structural measures in Germany, this is to yield significant savings from 2021onward. The EBITmargin should reach the target level of over 9%by 2023at the latest. In China, demand should gradually pick up again after muted conditions in 2018and 2019. As a technology leader, the HOMAGGroup is benefiting from the growing digitalization and automation­ of furniture production. ANNUAL REPORT 2019 91 COMBINED MANAGEMENT REPORT Report on risks, opportunities and expected future development: Expected future development Expected future development UNCERTAIN PROSPECTS FOR MACROECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT Prior to the corona outbreak, the global economy was expected to expand at a stable rate of around 3%per year in 2020and 2021, according to economic experts. Given the recent developments, we must now assume that forecasts for 2020will have to be corrected. The central banks look set to continue their accommodative monetary policies in 2020. Many governments have signi­ficantly widened public spending, which should stimulate the economy, but will simultaneously cause public-sector deficits to widen again. The growth forecasts for 2020and 2021, published in January, are summarized in table 2.68. Inflationary pressures are expected to remain low worldwide in 2020, although wages and salaries have increased, in some cases significantly­. One reason for this is technological progress, for example in the area of digitalization. On the other hand, sharper price increases are unlikely given the intense international compe- tition. The ECBhas announced that it will be maintaining its ­policy of low interest rates. In the United States, the Federal Reserve ­lowered interest rates in March 2020to prevent a financial crisis in the wake of the coronavirus spread. 2.68 -GROWTH FORECAST FOR GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT AUTOMOTIVE AND FURNITURE INDUSTRIES Our main sell-side industries, the automotive industry and furniture manufacturers, experienced a lull in their long-term growth trajectories in 2018and 2019. Looking to 2020, observers have predicted moderate growth for both sectors again, although the rapid spreading of the coronavirus is now casting doubt over this prediction. As things currently stand, spending on plant and equipment is expected to rise by just under 2%in ­Germany in 2020. According to a forecast published by LMCAutomotive in Janu- ary 2020, global automotive production should widen by 1.2%to 90.6million units in 2020. Whereas production in the United States is expected to rise by 5.4%, LMCAutomotive forecasts flat conditions in Europe and China. However, given the decline in output caused by the corona epidemic, it is currently more likely that global automotive production will shrink in 2020. Looking ­further down the road, LMCAutomotive assumes that global automotive production will grow by just under 3%, underpinned by strong consumer­ confidence and low borrowing costs. One important factor for the growth projected for the automotive industry is the increasing need for mobility in the emerging markets. The Centre for Industrial Studies (CSIL) forecasts growth of 2.4%in the furniture industry in 2020. However, this figure would place growth at a rate below the average of recent years. This forecast was also made before the coronavirus outbreak.

This is mainly due to the weak order intake in2019 and a correspondingly lower order back- log. TheVDMA trade association for woodworking machinery projects a10 % drop in sales in2020, also as a result of the muted order intake in2019. THE AUTOMOTIVE AND FURNITURE INDUSTRIES­ REMAIN OUR MAIN SELL-SIDE SECTORS, ­ENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGY IS GAINING IN IMPORTANCE In 2020, the project and investment volume of relevance for us in the automotive industry could just about repeat the level seen in 2019. However, the uncertainty around the corona crisis could lead to planned investments being put on hold. Spending on production technology for electric vehicles is likely to continue playing an important role given the ever-­growing demand for battery and hybrid vehicles. In addition, capacity­ expansion, reductions in unit costs and more flexible production for different model types remain the most important investment factors driving capital spending in the automotive industry. Demand in the woodworking industry for production technology is likely to decline slightly again, remaining flat at best in 2020. In China, there are growing signs of the downward trend bottoming out after the market contracted by roughly half in 2018and 2019. One positive aspect in our market assessment is that the global furniture industry is undergoing a consolidation process from which larger companies are emerging. This should spur our systems business with automated production lines in the medium and long term. In addition, consumers are increasingly demanding individually configured furniture. As a result, demand for flexible production lines with batch size 1capabilities is increasing on the part of pro- ducers. Another factor driving demand is the digitalization of production facilities. The automotive and furniture industries remain our most important customer groups. Following the acquisition of Megtec/­Uni- versal, however, environmental technology business is also gaining in importance. For our success, digitalization is becoming increasingly important across all divisions, offering as it does the opportunity to bind customers by offering them new services­ and optimization concepts and to differentiate ourselves from our peers. We do not intend to fundamentally change our ­business policy. SALES IN 2020: PROBABLY SLIGHTLY ABOVE PREVIOUS YEAR'S LEVEL This outlook assumes that growth in the global economy will not be any less than expected, that there are no further macro­economic dislocations and that political uncertainties do not increase any ­further. The effects the corona epidemic has had so far have been factored into the outlook. Earnings look set to come under appreciable pressure in the first quarter­ of 2020due to postponements caused by the epidemic. As things currently stand, it is uncertain to what extent the corona crisis will impact the economy and trade in 2020as a whole. From today´s perspective, we consider it possible that the declines incurred so far can for the most part be recouped in the further course of the year. However the economic risks resulting from the corona crisis have increased significantly since the beginning of March 2020. Looking ahead over the next few years from today's perspective, we are seeking slight organic growth in sales and have defined a target range of € 3,900to 4,100million for 2020. Order intake should reach Total costs (cost of sales and overheads, other operating expenses) are expected to remain steady in 2020. The largest cost items will continue to be the cost of materials and personnel expense, with the latter likely to increase at a slower pace in 2020than in 2019. Both gross profit and the gross margin (2019: 21.4%) are expected to improve slightly. EBIT MARGIN: INCREASE IN 2020 In 2020, the EBITmargin is likely to exceed the previous year's ­figure; a target corridor of 5.2to 5.7%has been defined (2019: 5.0%). As things currently stand, the extraordinary expenses included in EBITshould drop to around € 40million (2019: € 67.2million). In addition to purchase price allocation effects of € 17million, they will also include non-recurring optimization expenses in various divisions. These one-offs are included in the full-year forecasts for the Group and the divisions. It is already certain that non-recurring expenses totaling € 6.0million will arise in the first quarter of 2020for structural measures at the Karlstein and Goldkronach plants. Of this amount, € 3.5million is attributable to the Application Technology division and € 2.4million to the Clean Technology Systems division. ANNUAL REPORT 2019 93 COMBINED MANAGEMENT REPORT Report on risks, opportunities and expected future development: Expected future development The Dürr Group's EBITmargin adjusted for extraordinary effects is expected to reach a range of 6.2to 6.7%in 2020. At Woodworking Machinery and Systems, most of the efficiency enhancements and savings that have been initiated will have a positive impact on earnings from 2021onward. In 2020, the division should report lower EBITbefore extraordinary effects in tandem with a slight decline in sales. However, EBITshould be higher after extraordinary effects. RISING EARNINGS AFTER TA XES Net finance expense should decline in 2020. Given an expected tax rate of around 28%, earnings after taxes should rise to between confidence in the Group's future performance. ROCEpage 201should reach a range of 17to 22%in 2020, thus significantly exceeding the cost of capital. SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN CASH FLOW EXPECTED We expect the cash flow from operating activities to improve to between € 180and 230million in 2020. Free cash flowpage 201is also expected to increase significantly, coming within a range of decrease, partly as a result of a reduction in inventories. Cash flow and cash and cash equivalents should be easily sufficient to cover operating funding requirements (capital expenditure, interest ­payments etc.) as well as the dividend payout. CAPITAL EXPENDITURE We expect capital expenditure on property, plant and equipment and intangible assets to remain at the normal level of € 95to 105million in 2020. One goal of our mid-term strategy is to pur- sue further corporate and technology acquisitions, although no major acquisition is currently on the horizon. It will be possible for us to fund a possible transaction with our high cash position and cash flow. NET FINANCIAL STATUS, LIQUIDIT Y AND FUNDING As things currently stand, we project a net financial statuspage 201of €-80to -30million for the end of 2020. This does not include possible outflows for acquisitions. Cash and cash equivalents should amount to between € 680and 730million at the end of 2020. Once again, we do not expect to draw on the cash credit line under our syndicated loan in 2020. We currently have no intention of raising any fresh capital; this would only be an option in an exceptional case in the event of a large acquisition. We have a stable funding position, with the syndicated loan agreed in summer 2019continuing until 2024. EXPECTATIONS FOR 2021 Turning to 2021, we project a slight increase in order intake and sales. We expect a significant improvement in operatingEBIT(EBITbefore extraordinary effects), so that the operating EBITmargin could reach a range of 7.0to 7.5%. The cash flow from operating activities is also likely to continue growing and, as things currently­ stand, an increase to between € 230and 280million appears realistic. Table 2.70summarizes the expected figures for the main financial performance indicators in 2020. CHANGES IN THE PAINT AND FINAL ASSEMBLY­ SYSTEMS AND MEASURING AND PROCESS SYSTEMS DIVISIONS At the beginning of 2020, we reorganized our automotive final assembly business. Testing technologypage 200,assembly products and automotive filling technologypage 200were transferred from the Measuring and Process Systems division to Paint and Final Assembly Systems. Together with the final assembly activities based there, they form a powerful unit that provides better customer ser- vice. We are thus well positioned to take expansion in final assembly technology to the next level and to exploit the potential for growth offered by the electromobility transformation­ in this business in particular. In 2019, testing technology, assembly products­ and automotive filling technology contributed € 183million to order intake and € 179million to sales in the Measuring and ­Process Systems division. The outlook for the divisions for 2020in table 2.71factors in the changes made at Paint and Final Assembly ­Systems and ­Measuring and Process Systems. 94 ANNUAL REPORT 2019 COMBINED MANAGEMENT REPORT Report on risks, opportunities and expected future development: Expected future development 2.70 -GROUP OUTLOOK at best, remain flat.

This combination is an important competitive differentiator. Consolidated sales should grow by a percentage rate in the low single digits to between€ 3,900and4,100million in2020. The Group'sEBITmargin is also expected to increase, as we anticipate a decline in extraordinary expenses; our target is5.2to5.7%. The operatingEBITmargin should reach6.2to6.7%. Earnings after taxes are expected to rise to between€ 135and150million. Underpinned by significant increases in the cash flow from operating activities andfree cash flow page 201, thenet financial ­status page 201should improve to between €-80and -30million by the end of 2020. For 2021, we expect a significant improvement in earnings. The SUMMARIZED STATEMENT BY THE BOARD OF MANAGEMENT ON PROJECTED DEVELOPMENTS Provided the corona epidemic does not impact the economy too severely, capital spending in the automotive industry relevant to us in 2020could just about reach the previous year's level. A considerable proportion of this is likely to continue flowing into production technology for electric vehicles. This makes electromo- bility an opportunity for us and a key success factor. We expect demand in the woodworking industry to decline slightly or, target­ is an operating EBITmargin of 7.0to 7.5%. At the same time, the cash flow from operating activities should continue to widen to between € 230and 280million and contribute to a further strengthening of our financial situation. The targeted improvement in earnings is to be largely driven by increases at the HOMAGGroup. As part of its optimization course, it is implementing various savings and efficiency enhancement measures, which will unleash their full effect in 2021. On this basis, the HOMAGGroup should achieve its target EBITmargin of over 9%by 2023at the latest. The medium-­ term EBITmargin target for the Dürr Group as a whole is at least 8%. 2.71 -OUTLOOK BY DIVISION Order intake (€ million) Sales (€ million) EBIT margin (%) 2019¹ 2020 target 2019¹ 2020 target 2019¹ 2020 target 2019 act. adjusted 2019 act. adjusted 2019 adjusted Paint and Final Assembly Systems 1,341.0 1,524.1 1,300-1,500 1,243.8 1,422.5 1,400-1,500 5.0 5.4 5.0-5.5 Application Technology 640.8 - 610-660 592.8 - 620-670 9.6 - 9.0-10.0 Clean Technology Systems 449.1 - 420-460 395.3 - 400-440 3.1 - 3.2-4.2 Measuring and Process Systems 425.9 242.8 220-250 410.4 231.7 240-270 9.4 9.6 9.5-10.5 Woodworking Machinery and Systems 1,219.6 - 1,150-1,250 1,279.1 - 1,150-1,250 2.9 - 4.5-5.5 1 Effective January 1, 2020, testing technology, assembly products and filling technology for final vehicle assembly were transferred from the Measuring and Process Systems division to the Paint and Final Assembly Systems division. ANNUAL REPORT 2019 95 ZUSAMMENGEFASSTCOMBINEDMANAGEMENTRLAGEBERICHTREPORT Dürr AG (GermanDürrAGCommercial(HGB) Code) DÜRR AG (GERMAN COMMERCIAL CODE) DürrAG's annual financial statements are prepared in accordance with the provisions of the German Commercial Code, whereas the consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance withIFRS. As the holding company, DürrAGcomprises the Group's ­central functions and does not engage in any operating business of its own. Its economic condition mainly hinges on the business performance of the Group's operating companies. DürrAGholds shares in133companies directly or indirectly. The economic environment in which DürrAGoperates is essentially the same as the Group's and is described in the chapter entitled\"Economy and industry­ environment\" ­page 53. RESULTS OF OPER ATIONS Net finance expense increased by 6.9%over the previous year as interest expense was incurred from July 2019for the new sustainability Schuldschein loan. Income taxes were down as a result of the lower earnings in the tax group in Germany. Net income declined chiefly due to the lower net investment income. However, at € 61.4million, it is sufficient to cover the proposed dividend payout. At € 569.9million, net retained profit was virtually unchanged. The profit carried forward from the previous year included in this figure increased because € 83.1million of the net income for 2018remained after the dividend payment. 2.72 -DÜRR AG INDIVIDUAL FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - INCOME­ STATEMENT (GERMAN COMMERCIAL CODE) In 2019Dürr AG's sales increased by 7.4%over the previous year. They chiefly arise from payments made by the Group companies under transfer pricing agreements for the services provided by Dürr AGas the holding company. Lower currency-translation gains were the main reason for the 46.8%decline in other operating income to € 12.9million. However, currency-translation losses also dropped by a similar ­magnitude. Together with lower consulting costs, this contributed to a 30.3%drop in other operating expenses. The 9.4%decrease in personnel­ expense was primarily due to lower variable compensation as a result of weaker earnings. The most important item in Dürr AG's income statement is net investment income. At € 78.1million, it was down sharply in 2019as Dürr AGreceived less income from profit and loss transfer agreements than in the previous year. This was primarily due to the decline in the HOMAGGroup's earnings as a result of operating decreases and high extraordinary expenses. In addition, other domestic companies' earnings were also lower due partly to the fact that a number of older orders with low margins had been completed. 2019 2018 37.0 34.5 12.9 24.1 -3.6 -3.7 -18.7 -20.7 -1.0 -1.0 -29.8 -42.8 78.1 193.4 -9.5 -8.9 -3.7 -22.6 -0.1 - 61.4 152.3 508.4 425.3 569.9 577.6 96 ANNUAL REPORT 2019 COMBINED MANAGEMENT REPORT Dürr AG (German Commercial­Code) NET ASSETS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION Dürr AG's total assets rose by 23.5%over the end of 2018to At € 814.6million, equity was virtually unchanged over the end of 2018. The minimal decline in net retained profit is due to the fact that the dividend payment for 2018(€ 69.2million) distributed in May 2019exceeded net income for 2019(€ 61.4million). Provisions increased from € 16.5million to € 18.7million. Higher tax provisions were offset by lower additions to provisions for bonus payments. The significant increase of 51.1%in liabilities is due to the new sustainability Schuldschein loan. A further factor was that we received more liquidity from our subsidiaries under the cash pooling system. 2.73 -DÜRR AG INDIVIDUAL FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - BALANCE­ SHEET (GERMAN COMMERCIAL CODE) € million Dec. 31, 2019 Dec. 31, 2018 ASSETS Non-current assets Intangible assets 7.4 8.2 Property, plant and equipment 0.2 0.3 Financial assets 860.9 799.7 868.5 808.2 Current assets Receivables and other assets 723.7 489.7 Cash and cash equivalents 351.0 274.1 1,074.6 763.8 Prepaid expenses, sundry items 2.0 2.5 1,076.6 766.3 Total assets 1,945.1 1,574.5 EQUITY AND LIABILITIES Equity Subscribed capital 177.2 177.2 Capital reserve 67.6 67.6 Net retained profit 569.9 577.6 814.6 822.4 Liabilities Provisions 18.7 16.5 Liabilities 1,111.8 735.7 1,130.5 752.1 Total equity and liabilities 1,945.1 1,574.5 OPPORTUNITIES AND RISKS Dürr AGis exposed to the opportunities and risks of its subsidiar- ies.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES­ The Company Dürr Aktiengesellschaft (\"Dürr AG\" or the \"Company\") has its registered offices in Stuttgart, Germany. Its headquarters for operations are located at Carl-Benz-Strasse34in 74321Bietigheim-­ Bissingen. The Dürr Group, which consists of Dürr AGand its subsidiaries, is a mechanical and plant engineering company with distinct competence in automation and digitalization. The Group is one of the global market leaders in almost all of its fields of business. In addition to the automotive industry, it also acts as supplier of production technology for other industries including the mechanical engineering, energy, chemical and pharmaceutical industries as well as the woodworking industry. The Dürr Group serves the market with five global divisions: Paint and Final Assembly Systems offers assembly and paint finishing technology, mainly for the auto­ motive industry. Application Technology manufactures products and systems for automated painting applications as well as sealing and glueing technology. Clean Technology Systems primarily manufactures plant and equipment for purifying exhaust gases. The machines and systems produced by Measuring and Process Systems are used, among other things, in engine and transmission construc- tion. Woodworking Machinery and Systems develops and manu­ factures such machinery and systems. Accounting policies The consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union (EU) at the end of the reporting period, and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to Sec. 315e (1) HGB[\"Handelsgesetzbuch\": German Commercial Code]. The accounting policies used generally correspond to the policies applied in the prior period. In addition, the Group has applied the new and/or revised standards and the interpretations issued by the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) that became mandatory for the first time in the2019reporting period.Table 3.6 IFRS 16\"Leases\" regulates the recognition, measurement and presentation of leases. Pursuant to IFRS 16, lessees no longer differentiate between operating and finance leases, but instead account for most leases as right-of-use assets and lease liabilities. Lessors, by contrast, continue to differentiate between operating and finance leases. The accounting treatment of leases was changed in compliance with the transitional provisions of IFRS 16. The Dürr Group has opted to adopt the standard applying the modified retrospective method, with the cumulative effect from the adjustment being recognized­ without impact on profit or loss as of the date of first-time appli­ cation. The prior-period figures have not been adjusted. Pastperiods­ can therefore only be compared with the 2019reporting period to a limited extent. The transition as of January 1, 2019reduced equity by € 9,511thou- sand. Total assets rose by € 94,957thousand, an increase of 2.6%. A reconciliation of all items affected in the statement of financial position as well as other financial obligations as of December 31, 2018to lease liabilities as of January 1, 2019is presented in 108 ANNUAL REPORT 2019 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the consolidated financial statements 3.6 -CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING POLICIES FROM THE ADOPTION OF THE NEW AND REVISED STANDARDS AND INTERPRETATIONS First-time Adopted by the Impact on the application1 EU Commission Dürr Group NEW STANDARDS IFRS 16 \"Leases\" January 1, 2019 Yes Significant AMENDED STANDARDS/INTERPRETATIONS IFRS 9 \"Financial Instruments\" - Prepayment features with negative compensation payment January 1, 2019 Yes Immaterial IAS 19 \"Employee Benefits\" - Plan amendment, curtailment or settlement January 1, 2019 Yes Immaterial IAS 28 \"Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures\" January 1, 2019 Yes No IFRIC 23 \"Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments\" January 1, 2019 Yes Immaterial Annual Improvements to IFRSs (2015-2017 cycle) January 1, 2019 No Immaterial 1 The standards/amendments/interpretations are effective for reporting periods beginning on or after the specified date. 3.7 -ACCOUNTING STANDARDS AND INTERPRETATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN PUBLISHED BUT NOT YET ADOPTED IN THE REPORTING PERIOD First-time Adopted by the Impact on the application1 EU Commission Dürr Group NEW STANDARDS IFRS 17 \"Insurance Contracts\" January 1, 2021 No Immaterial AMENDED STANDARDS/INTERPRETATIONS IFRS 3 \"Business Combinations\" January 1, 2020 No Immaterial IAS 1 \"Presentation of Financial Statements\" and IAS 8 \"Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors\" - Definition of material January 1, 2020 Yes No IAS 1 \"Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-Current\" January 1, 2022 No No Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39 and IFRS 7 concerning the IBOR reform January 1, 2020 Yes No Changes in references to the Framework in IFRS standards January 1, 2020 Yes Immaterial 1 The standards/amendments/interpretations are effective for reporting periods beginning on or after the specified date. The Group elected not to adopt standards and IFRICinterpretations early which have already been issued but have not yet become effective. Generally speaking, the Dürr Group intends to adopt all standards when they become effective. The requirements of the standards applied have been satisfied in full. The financial statements thus give a true and fair view of the net assets, financial position and results of operations and cash flows of the Group. The Dürr Group's reporting period is the calendar year. The consolidated financial statements are prepared in euros; all amounts are presented in thousands of euro, unless stated otherwise. All assets and liabilities are measured at historical or amortized cost. Exceptions to this rule are derivative financial instruments measured at fair value, other financial assets as well as financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss or through other ANNUAL REPORT 2019 109 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the consolidated financial statements comprehensive income. Obligations from options held by non-­ controlling interests, liabilities from contingent purchase price installments and obligations from share-based compensation are also measured at fair value. Assets and liabilities are treated as current if they are realized or settled within twelve months of the end of the reporting period. Within the statement of financial position, assets and liabilities with a remaining term of more than twelve months are presented as non-current. By contrast, deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities within the statement of financial position are always reported as non-current. Besides this, liabilities with a remaining term of between one and five years are presented in the notes to the consolidated financial statements as medium-term and those with a remaining term of more than five years as long-term. 2. BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION The financial statements of the Dürr Group are based on the IFRSfinancial statements of Dürr AGand the consolidated subsidiaries and entities accounted for using the equity method as of December 31, 2019, prepared in accordance with uniform policies and audited by independent auditors. For subsidiaries included in the consolidated financial statements for the first time, acquisition accounting is performed according to the acquisition method of accounting pursuant to IFRS 3\"Busi- ness Combinations\". This involves offsetting the cost of the shares acquired against the proportionate equity of the subsidiaries. All assets and liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired are included in the consolidated statement of financial position at the acquisition date, taking hidden reserves and encumbrances into account. Any remaining positive difference is shown as goodwill. Negative differences are posted immediately to profit or loss. For acquisitions in which less than 100%of the shares are purchased, IFRS 3provides for a choice between the purchased goodwill method and the full goodwill method. This option can be exercised for every business combination. The Dürr Group determines the method to be used to recognize the goodwill for each business combination. For information on exercising the option for individual business combina- tions, please refer to note 18.Changes in interests for subsidi­aries which cause the Group's interest to increase or decrease without losing control are treated as transactions between equity providers that do not affect profit or loss. Intragroup sales revenues, other income and expenses, all intragroup receivables, liabilities, provisions and cash and cash equivalents received and paid are eliminated. Intragroup profits which are not realized by sale to third parties are eliminated. Entities over which Dürr exercises significant influence (associ- ates) are accounted for using the equity method. Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy of the investee. Interests in entities accounted for using the equity method are initially recognized at cost. Costs exceeding the share in the net assets of the entity accounted for using the equity method, after taking into account hidden reserves or encumbrances, are ­recognized as goodwill. Goodwill resulting from the acquisition of an associate is included in the carrying amount of the entity accounted for using the equity method and is not amortized, but tested instead for impairment as part of the overall carrying amount of the entity accounted for using the equity method. For subsequent measurement, the Dürr Group's share of the profit or loss of the entity accounted for using the equity method is recorded under investment result in the consolidated statement of income. The share in other comprehensive income is recognized directly in Group equity. The cumulative changes after the acquisition date increase or decrease the carrying amount of the entity accounted for using the equity method. Dividends received are deducted from the carrying amount. If the losses of an entity accounted for using the equity method attributable to the Group correspond to or exceed the value of the interest in this entity, no further losses are recognized unless the Group has entered into obligations or has made payments for the entity accounted for using the equity method. 110 ANNUAL REPORT 2019 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the consolidated financial statements 3. CONSOLIDATED GROUP Besides Dürr AG, the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2019contain all German and foreign entities which Dürr AGcan control directly or indirectly. Under IFRS 10\"Consoli- dated Financial Statements\", control exists if an entity is exposed, or has rights, to positive or negative returns from its involvement with another entity. It must also have the ability to affect these variable returns through its power over the investee. Control can exist due to voting rights or prevailing circumstances as a result of contractual arrangements, among other things. The entities are included in the consolidated financial statements of Dürr from the date on which the possibility of control was obtained. For most of the Group companies, control is based on holding the majority of voting rights. On account of the contractual arrange- ments, the Dürr Group has the power to exercise control over four entities, although in each case the Group only holds 50%of the shares or 50%or less of the voting rights in the company. At two of the entities, the Group can bring about a decision in case of parity of votes; at the other two entities, the Dürr Group assumes operational management. Consolidation of an entity included in the consolidated financial statements ceases when the Dürr Group loses control over the entity. Structured entities A structured entity is often characterized by restricted activities and a narrow and precisely defined purpose. A key characteristic is that voting rights do not have any significant effect on the returns from this entity. The possibility of control does not result from the majority interest in capital or from voting rights, but rather from contractual arrangements. As in the prior period, the consolidated group included a structured entity in the 2019reporting period. This was a lease property company with properties in Bietigheim-Bissingen. The Group was the tenant of these properties as well as the lender of the entity; however, it did not hold any shares in this entity. There were no obligations for financial support; the loan was secured by a land charge registered to the Dürr Group. As of December 31, 2019, the Dürr Group acquired the properties, the loan was repaid and the lease property company was deconsolidated. Entities accounted for using the equity method Entities over which the Dürr Group exercises significant influence pursuant to IAS 28\"Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures\" (associates) as well as joint ventures as defined by IFRS 11\"Joint Arrangements\" are accounted for using the equity method. Significant influence is presumed with a share of voting rights ranging from 20%to 50%. Associates are included in the consolidated financial statements using the equity method from the date on which the possibility of significant influence existed. For shares of voting rights below 20%, interests in entities are generally recognized under other investments. 3.8 -NUMBER OF ENTITIES Dec. 31, 2019 Dec. 31, 2018 FULLY CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES Germany 28 30 Other countries 98 104 126 134 ENTITIES ACCOUNTED FOR USING THE EQUITY METHOD Germany - - Other countries 2 2 2 2 OTHER INVESTMENTS Germany 3 3 Other countries 2 2 5 5 The consolidated financial statements contain 11entities (prior period: 15) which have non-controlling interests in them. There are four companies that are only included in the consolidated financial statements at cost on grounds of immateriality. Their revenue contribution to total Group sales revenues, the earnings contribution to Group earnings (before taxes) as well as the contribution of equity to Group equity is less than 0.05%. The Dürr Group is not exposed to any risks from these entities due to their size, contribution to sales revenues, complexity and minor activities.

CURRENCY TR ANSL ATION Financial statements denominated in the foreign currency of the subsidiaries included in the consolidation are translated to the euro on the basis of the functional currency concept pursuant to IAS 21\"The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates\". For the majority of foreign subsidiaries in the Group, the functional currency is the local currency, since these entities operate independently from a financial, economic and organizational viewpoint. According to this concept, assets and liabilities are thus translated at closing rates, while income and expenses are generally translated at average rates. Any currency translation differences are recorded without effect on profit or loss in other comprehensive income. In the separate financial statements of Dürr AGand its subsi­diaries, receivables and liabilities in a currency other than the euro are measured at the historical rate; current transactions are translated at the current exchange rate. Any exchange rate gains and losses at the end of the reporting period are included in the statement of income. For actual figures of the exchange rate gains and losses recognized through profit or loss, please refer to In the separate financial statements of the foreign subsidiaries, goodwill is translated at the rate prevailing at the end of the Group's reporting period. The hidden reserves identified in acquisitions are accounted for using the functional currency of the acquired entity. An adjusted average rate is used for entities consolidated for the first time during the year. 3.10 -SIGNIFICANT EXCHANGE RATES Closing rate Average rate in relation Dec. 31, 2019 2019 to one euro Dec. 31, 2018 2018 Brazilian real (BRL) 4.5133 4.4449 4.4173 4.3244 Pound sterling (GBP) 0.8501 0.8971 0.8757 0.8862 Chinese renminbi (CNY) 7.8328 7.8600 7.7175 7.8167 Danish krone (DKK) 7.4710 7.4675 7.4658 7.4533 Indian rupee (INR) 80.1500 79.9088 78.7689 80.6401 Korean won (KRW) 1,296.3900 1,276.9371 1,302.9746 1,295.4805 Mexican peso (MXN) 21.2392 22.5196 21.6402 22.6299 Polish zloty (PLN) 4.2597 4.2981 4.2998 4.2679 Swiss franc (CHF) 1.0856 1.1266 1.1113 1.1515 US dollar (USD) 1.1228 1.1453 1.1197 1.1792 112 ANNUAL REPORT 2019 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the consolidated financial statements 6. ADJUSTMENT OF THE FIGURES IN THE ­STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION The first-time application ofIFRS 16\"Leases\" as of January 1, 2019, resulted in adjustments being made to the opening statement of financial position. The transition was made using the modified retrospective method. With this method, the right-of-use asset is recognized on the asset side as if IFRS 16had been applied as of the commencement date of the lease, but using the incremental borrowing rate as of the transition date and less any accumulated depreciation. Discounted future payments were recognized under liabilities. The difference between these figures from the transition was recognized without impact on profit or loss directly in equity. Furthermore, the Dürr Group made use of the practical expedient in connection with the first-time application and did not reassess whether an agreement contains a lease pursuant to IFRS 16. Instead, the standard was applied to agreements previously containing a lease pursuant to IAS 17\"Leases\" and IFRIC 4\"Determining whether an Arrangement contains a Lease\". In using the expedient, the Group also adjusted right-of-use assets to account for any provisions for onerous lease agreements that had been recognized in the statement of financial position as of the date of transition. The Dürr Group exercised the option not to apply IFRS 16to leases ending within 12months of the date of first-time application. These were accounted for in the same way as short-term leases and recognized under expenses for short- term leases. Leases previously classified as finance leases are continued as before. Table 3.11presents the adjustments of the statement of financial position items affected. 3.11 -IFRS 16: RECONCILIATION OF THE STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION ITEMS AFFECTED AS OF JANUARY 1, 2019 Dec. 31, 2018 Adjustments Jan. 1, 2019 € k reported IFRS 16 adjusted ASSETS Non-current assets 1,244,305 95,000 1,339,305 Property, plant and equipment 433,828 90,812 524,640 Investment property 19,203 1,971 21,174 Deferred tax assets 49,893 2,217 52,110 Current assets 2,370,094 -43 2,370,051 Other assets 54,003 -43 53,960 Total assets Dürr Group 3,614,399 94,957 3,709,356 ANNUAL REPORT 2019 113 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the consolidated financial statements 3.11 -IFRS 16: RECONCILIATION OF THE STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION ITEMS AFFECTED AS OF JANUARY 1, 2019 Dec. 31, 2018 Adjustments Jan. 1, 2019 € k reported IFRS 16 adjusted EQUITY AND LIABILITIES Total equity 992,151 -9,511 982,640 Non-current liabilities 786,081 81,738 867,819 Other provisions 19,058 -1,204 17,854 Other financial liabilities 12,827 83,329 96,156 Sundry financial liabilities 6,266 -143 6,123 Deferred tax liabilities 91,949 -244 91,705 Current liabilities 1,836,167 22,730 1,858,897 Other provisions 130,676 -554 130,122 Financial liabilities 12,496 23,328 35,824 Sundry financial liabilities 347,698 -44 347,654 Total equity and liabilities Dürr Group 3,614,399 94,957 3,709,356 Notes on adjustments to the items in the statement of financial position Property, plant and equipment and investment property In the transition to IFRS 16, right-of-use assets of € 92,783thousand were recognized for the first time. Of this,€ 90,812thousand related to property, plant and equipment and € 1,971thousand to investment property. Investment property relates to right-of-use assets held by Schenck Technologie- und Industriepark GmbH in Darm- stadt for buildings that are sublet under operating leases. Please refer to note 18for more information on right-of-use assets. Other assets For individual lease agreements within the Dürr Group, lease ­payments are made when or before the leased asset is made avail- able. With the first-time application of IFRS 16, these are recognized as part of the acquisition costs of the right-of-use asset. This led to rent prepayments of € 43thousand being reclassified from other assets to right-of-use assets. Other provisions The Dürr Group makes use of the exception and adjusts right-of- use assets by the amount of any provisions for onerous leases. As a result, other provisions decreased by € 1,758thousand. Financial liabilities As a result of the transition, lease liabilities increased by Deferred taxes Deferred tax assets on financial liabilities and deferred tax liabilities on property, plant and equipment and investment property increased significantly due to the application of IFRS 16, as the Dürr Group recognizes deferred taxes on all differences arising from the commencement date of a lease.

Under IFRS 16these are taken into account in the lease term. Further explanations on individual items and options are provided innote 7. 7. RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT POLICIES Revenue recognition pursuant to IFRS 15 \"Revenue from Contracts with Customers\" The Dürr Group generates most of its sales revenues from the production and delivery of customer-specific plant and machinery. For these contracts, the sales revenues and planned gross margin is realized in accordance with the percentage of completion method (PoC method) in line with the percentage of completion of a contract over the performance period. The criteria of IFRS 15for this are: the asset does not have any other alternative usage and, at the same time, the Group has an enforceable right to payment for work already per- formed. The progress towards satisfaction of a performance obligation is calculated on the basis of the costs incurred relative­ to the total estimated costs (cost-to-cost method). This ensures that both sales revenues and the associated costs are systematically recorded and therefore the profit or loss from the contract is recognized in the period incurred over which the control over the goods or services­ is transferred. Customer payments are contractually agreed and based on the progress of projects and on milestones set. This keeps the time that elapses between customer payments and progress towards satisfaction of a performance obligation to a minimum. The Group came to the conclusion that the input-based method is best suited for determining the progress towards satisfaction of a performance obligation as the Group uses IT-supported calculation ­methods and, with the help of division-specific project controlling, is able to ­reliably estimate planned costs and monitor total costs. ANNUAL REPORT 2019 115 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the consolidated financial statements Where it is not possible to give a reliable estimation of the progress towards complete satisfaction of a performance obligation based on output factors or input factors, the zero profit method (ZPmethod) is applied as long as it can be assumed that the Dürr Group can recover the costs incurred from satisfying the performance obli- gation. With the zero profit method sales revenues and the associated costs are realized in equal amounts until it is possible to reliably estimate the progress towards complete satisfaction of a performance obligation. The gross margin is thus, in part at least, not made up for until a later stage of the contract and is recognized through profit or loss. The other portion of sales revenues from contracts with customers is generated from both the sale of standard machines, spare parts and other goods as well as the rendering of services. These sales revenues are recognized at the date on which the customer obtains ­control over the promised asset. This is usually the point in time when the machine is delivered to the customer, at which point the customer obtains legal title to the machine or has inspected it. Services are rendered and recorded as sales revenues upon their com- pletion. For standard machines and spare parts, the customer makes the payment upon receiving the invoice, which is done following delivery or inspection, depending on the contractual arrangements. In this case, advance payments are also invoiced to the customer. Performance obligations The Group divides its contracts with customers into performance obligations, separating them based on contractual terms into performance obligations that are either satisfied at a point in time or over time. The customer contracts are analyzed for separable performance obligations. In addition to the performance obligation to produce a machine or plant for the customer, separable performance obligations in the Paint and Final Assembly Systems, Application Technology and Clean Technology Systems divisions mainly include spare parts packages and partial modifications. In the Measuring­ and Process Systems and Woodworking Machinery and ­Systems divisions, it is primarily the assembly and commissioning that play a role as distinct performance obligations. Intangible assets Intangible assets comprise goodwill, franchises, brand names, industrial rights and similar rights, internally generated software, capitalized development costs as well as acquired customer rela- tionships, orders and technological know-how. Purchased and internally generated intangible assets are recognized pursuant to IAS 38\"Intangible Assets\" if, in addition to other criteria, it is probable that a future economic benefit will flow to the entity from the use of the asset, and the cost of the asset can be reliably determined. Intangible assets are recognized at cost. Intangible assets with a finite useful life are amortized over their useful life using the straight-line method, unless they are impaired. Goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized. Other intangible assets are tested once annually to determine whether events and circumstances still justify the assumption that they have an indefinite useful life. If this is not the case, the estimated useful life is changed from indefinite to finite in accordance with the requirements of IAS 8\"Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors\". Likewise, intangible assets with an indefinite useful life are tested once annually or sooner if there are any indications that an asset may be impaired. In addition to goodwill, the Dürr Group recognizes brand names as further intangible assets with mostly indefinite useful lives. These brand names are tested annually for impairment alongside goodwill. Like good- will, the brand names are part of the net assets of a cash-generating unit. In the Group, development costs are only recognized as internally generated intangible assets if the conditions set forth in IAS 38are satisfied. These include the following criteria: Cost is the sum of all directly attributable expenditure incurred from the date when the intangible asset first meets the recognition criteria. Development costs which do not meet these criteria, as well as research costs, are recognized immediately as an expense. Amortization of capitalized development costs is disclosed under cost of sales in the statement of income. 116 ANNUAL REPORT 2019 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the consolidated financial statements 3.13 -USEFUL LIVES OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS (ESTIMATED) years Brand names with finite useful life (DUALIS, Megtec, Universal) 0 to 4 Capitalized development costs 2 to 10 Franchises, industrial rights and similar rights 2 to 20 Customer relationships 4 to 10 Technological know-how 5 to 15 Other brand names indefinite More information on the brand names is provided in note 18.

Cost comprises all production costs that are directly attributable to the production process. 3.14 -USEFUL LIVES OF PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT (ESTIMATED) years IT hardware 2 to 5 Machines and equipment 2 to 21 Furniture and fixtures 2 to 25 Buildings, hereditary building leases and leasehold improvements 3 to 50 Land indefinite The cost of property, plant and equipment includes major expenditures and replacements which extend useful lives or increase ­capacity. The historical cost of assets that are either sold or scrapped is derecognized, as is the accumulated depreciation. Any gains or losses from derecognition are determined as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount and recognized through profit or loss as other operating income or expenses in the period in which the item is derecognized. Costs of ongoing repairs and maintenance are posted immediately to profit or loss. Investment property Properties are allocated to investment property if a change in use has occurred which is substantiated by their being occupied by another party after the end of owner-occupation or the inception of an operating lease with another party. Investment property is recognized initially at (amortized) cost, including transaction costs. The carrying amount contains the costs for investments to replace an existing investment property at the time these costs are incurred, provided the recognition criteria are satisfied, and excludes the costs of day-to-day servicing of an investment property. Subsequent to initial recognition, investment properties are measured at amortized cost. Investment property is derecognized when it is sold or retired from active use and no future economic benefit is expected upon its dis- posal. Gains or losses arising from the retirement or disposal of investment property are recognized in the year of retirement or disposal. Leases Several entities in the Dürr Group lease land, buildings, technical equipment and machines as well as office and operating equipment. One entity leases properties to external lessees. A lease is a contract that transfers the right to use an asset (the leased asset) for a period of time in exchange for consideration. Since January 1, 2019, the Dürr Group as lessee has generally accounted for these leases as right-of-use assets and the corresponding payment obligations over the lease term as lease liabilities from the commencement date. The right-of-use assets are recognized under property, plant and equipment or investment property, while the lease liabilities are recognized as part of financial liabilities notes 18, 31, 36, 40 and 41.Lease liabilities correspond to the present value of the lease payments made over the lease term. These comprise the fixed payments, variable payments (if linked to an index or interest­ rate) and the exercise price of a purchase option if it is reasonably certain that the option will be exercised. In order to ensure that the terms are flexible, some leases for land and buildings in particular­ contain options to extend or terminate the lease. If it is reasonably certain that the option will be exercised or not, the ANNUAL REPORT 2019 117 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the consolidated financial statements optional periods are taken into account accordingly when determining the lease term. For discounting, the interest rate implicit in the lease is used if this can be determined. Otherwise, the incremental ­borrowing rate is used. Right-of-use assets are measured at acquisition cost and comprise the lease liabilities, dismantling obligations and rent prepayments. Lease liabilities and right-of-use assets are subsequently measured at amortized cost. The lease liability is measured using the effective interest method, i.e., the lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and a redemption of the lease liability. This is done so as to achieve a constant rate of interest over the period on the remaining balance of the lease liability. Notes 16 and 36contain disclosures on interest expenses and interest payments from leases. The lease liability is remeasured if the lease agreement is modified or changes are made to the lease payments, lease term or estimates regarding the exercise of purchase options. The right-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term and their estimated useful lives and adjusted for any remeasurements of the lease liability. 3.15 -USEFUL LIVES OF RIGHT-OF-USE ASSETS (ESTIMATED) years Vehicles 1 to 6 IT hardware 1 to 9 Machines and equipment 3 to 23 Land, buildings, hereditary building leases, office space 1 to 90 The Dürr Group makes use of the following exemptions and practical expedients: Furthermore, intragroup leases are recognized through profit or loss in the segment reporting pursuant to IFRS 8and not in the statement of financial position. Leases in which the Dürr Group is the lessor relate to investment property. For these leases, the opportunities and risks remain within the Group. The lease payments are recognized by the lessor separately from non-lease components on a straight-line basis as sales revenues from lease agreements. Leases pursuant to IAS 17 (prior period) Until December 31, 2018, lessees differentiated between operating and finance leases. In the Dürr Group, the majority of leases were classified as operating leases. Lease payments on operating leases were recorded as an expense in the statement of income over the lease term. Assets leased under finance leases, which transfer to the Group substantially­all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the leased asset, were capitalized at the inception of the lease at the fair value of the leased asset or, if lower, at the present value of the ­minimum lease payments. A liability was also established at that time for the same amount. The lease liability and lease asset from finance leases were subsequently measured at amortized cost in line with the subsequent measurement of leases pursuant to IFRS 16. Impairment testing for intangible assets and property, plant and equipment including right-of-use assets All intangible assets with an indefinite useful life, intangible assets which are not yet ready for use and goodwill are tested for impairment at the end of each reporting period. Sundry intangible assets and property, plant and equipment including right-of-use assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset may be impaired, i.e., that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Investment property that is largely rented to third parties is also subjected to an impairment test at least once a year. An impairment loss is recognized through profit or loss if the recoverable amount of the asset falls short of its carrying amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset's net selling price and 118 ANNUAL REPORT 2019 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the consolidated financial statements its value in use. The net selling price is the amount recoverable from the disposal of an asset at market conditions less costs to sell. Value in use is the fair value of estimated future cash flows expected to arise from the continuing use of an asset and from its disposal at the end of its useful life. The recoverable amount is determined for each asset individually or, if that is not possible, for the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. As regards goodwill acquired in business combinations, the relevant cash-generating units correspond to the business activities within the divisions of the Dürr Group based on internal reporting structures. To determine the estimated cash flows of each cash-generating unit, basic assumptions have to be made. These include assumptions regarding financial planning and the interest rates used for discounting. Impairment losses recognized in prior periods are reversed against profit or loss if they cease to exist or have decreased. The reversal of an impairment loss or the reduction of an impairment loss of an asset is, however, only recognized to the extent that it does not exceed the carrying amount that would have existed if the regular amortization or depreciation had been recorded and no impairment losses had been recognized. Impairments on goodwill may not be reversed. Other comments on intangible assets, property, plant and equipment and right-of-use assets can be found in note 18. Financial instruments A financial instrument is a contract that gives rise to both a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity instrument of another entity. Pursuant to IFRS 9\"Financial Instruments\", financial instruments are classified in the following categories: Purchases or sales of financial assets are recognized using trade date accounting. Financial assets Financial assets are classified in accordance with IFRS 9based on the business model used to manage financial assets and on the basis of the characteristics of the contractual cash flows of the ­financial assets. The objective of the Dürr Group's business model is to hold financial assets in order to collect contractual cash flows. With regard to the characteristics of the contractual cash flows, it is examined whether the contractual terms of the financial assets give rise on specific dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding. The financial assets in Dürr's portfolio are measured at amortized cost provided that the business model is complied with and the ­contractual cash flows fulfill the condition above. The business model for financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (debt instruments) includes both the holding and sale of financial assets. The contractual terms that have to be met give rise solely to payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding on specific dates. Equity instruments are generally classified as measured at fair value through profit or loss at initial recognition. However, upon initial recognition an irrevocable option may be exercised to classify­ equity instruments as measured at fair value through other comprehensive income. This option may only be exercised if the equity instruments are not held for trading and if they do not ­represent contingent consideration in a business combination. The Dürr Group ANNUAL REPORT 2019 119 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the consolidated financial statements generally holds its equity interests for strategic reasons as a way of expanding the Group's business operations. Focus is not placed on the intention to generate significant amounts of short-term gains on sale. Any fluctuations in the measurement of investments are therefore not expected to have any impact on the statement of income. Accordingly, equity instruments are classified as measured at fair value through other comprehensive income. Gains or losses of equity instruments in this category recognized through other comprehensive income are never reclassified to profit or loss. In derogation from this, the investment in SBSEcoclean GmbH is classified as at fair value through profit or loss. Inaddition­ to the investment in Parker Engineering Co., Ltd., the Dürr Group holds a put option accounted for through profit or loss. In order to keep the economic effect on the statement of income to a minimum here too, both the investment and the related option are classified at fair value through profit or loss. Parker Engineering Co., Ltd. is recognized in the statement of financial position under other financial assets, the option under sundry­ financial liabilities. Financial assets that do not satisfy the conditions for being classified as measured at amortized cost/at fair value through other comprehensive income are designated as measured at fair value through profit or loss. The Dürr Group does not currently make use of the option to measure financial assets at fair value through profit or loss at initial recognition. Valuation and impairment of financial assets IFRS 9introduces an impairment model based on the expected credit loss model, which is applicable for all financial assets (debt instruments) that are measured at amortized cost or at fair value through other comprehensive income. The expected credit loss model distinguishes between the general approach and the simplified approach. The general approach allocates the financial assets to three risk stages and is mainly applicable for cash and cash equi­ valents as well as sundry financial assets. The simplified approach, which is applicable for contract assets, trade receivables and lease receivables, does away with the first of the three risk stages. The Dürr Group allocates the financial assets to the individual valuation and impairment stages based on past-due criteria and historically tried-and-tested, qualitative internal and external risk assessments of the individual debtors. These assessments are applicable for all classes of financial assets. Provided that the non-derivative financial assets were not already impaired upon acquisition, the assets are allocated to stage 1. Generally speaking, a financial instrument is also allocated to stage 1if it is deemed to be investment grade by external rating agencies. If there has been a significant increase in the credit risk since initial recognition, the assets are allocated to stage 2. A number of qualitative criteria are used to assess whether the credit risk has increased significantly since a financial asset was recognized for the first time. This involves, for example, examining whether the total comprehensive income of the debtor has deteriorated significantly or whether it is expected to do so. Financial assets are allocated to stage 2at the latest when contractual payment is more than 30days past due. Financial assets are allocated to stage 3or their default is assumed once matters become known that could impair the ability of a certain debtor to meet its financial obligations. For all financial assets, this means observing the criteria of being 90days past due as well as using qualitative credit ratings for debtors. For example, the ­likelihood of insolvency or any other financial reorganization of the debtor results in the financial assets being allocated to stage 3. In deviation from the past due criteria mentioned above, trade receivables and contract assets measured in accordance with the simplified approach are allocated to stage 3, if they are more than twelve months past due. This appropriately reflects the industry-­ specific experience and payment patterns for long-term projects­ in the plant and machinery sector. Financial assets are derecognized as soon as reasonable information is available that indicates that they are uncollectible, such as insolvency proceedings coming to an end or following a court deci- sion. Further explanations on the valuation and impairment of financial assets can be found in note 41. Financial liabilities Financial liabilities generally give rise to the right to receive settle­ ment in cash or another financial asset. They include, for example, trade payables, liabilities to banks, bonds, Schuldschein loans, obligations from options, derivative financial liabilities and other financial liabilities. 120 ANNUAL REPORT 2019 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the consolidated financial statements After initial measurement, financial liabilities carried at amortized cost are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. Financial liabilities measured at fair value through profit or loss include financial liabilities held for trading­. Derivatives are deemed to be held for trading unless they are designated and effective hedging instruments. Gains or losses on financial­ ­liabilities held for trading are recognized through profit or loss. The Dürr Group has not yet made use of the option to designate financial liabilities upon initial recognition as financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss. Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting The Dürr Group uses derivative financial instruments such as forward exchange contracts in order to hedge against currency risks. For accounting of hedges, the Dürr Group continues to apply the regulations of IAS 39\"Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement\". Derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value on ­initial recognition and in subsequent periods. Recognition of these changes - whether through profit or loss or through other comprehensive income (hedge reserve) - depends on whether the derivative financial instrument is part of an effective hedge in accordance with IAS 39. Changes in fair value are recognized through profit or loss unless the special criteria of IAS 39for hedge accounting are satisfied. Depending on the nature of the hedged item, hedging instruments are designated as follows: flows that is attributable to a recognized asset or liability or a forecast transaction and could affect profit or loss; or Fair value hedge accounting In the case of fair value hedges, the carrying amount of a hedged item is adjusted through profit or loss by the profit or loss that is attributable to the hedged exposure. In addition, the derivative financial instrument is remeasured at its fair value. Gains or losses arising as a result are also recognized through profit or loss. In a perfect hedge, the fluctuation in fair value recognized through profit or loss for the hedged item practically offsets that of the hedging instrument. For fair value hedges which relate to hedged items carried at amortized cost, the adjustments of the carrying amount are released to profit or loss over their term until maturity. Every adjustment of the carrying amount of a hedged financial instrument is released to profit or loss using the effective interest method. The amount can be released as soon as an adjustment is made. It is released at the latest when the hedged item ceases to be adjusted for the changes in fair value that are attributable to the hedged expo- sure. If the hedged item is derecognized, the unamortized fair value is recognized immediately in the statement of income. If an unrecognized firm commitment is designated as a hedged item, the subsequent accumulated change in its fair value that is attributable to the hedged risk is recognized as an asset or liability in the profit or loss of the period. The changes in fair value of the hedging instrument are also recognized in the profit or loss of the period. However, this does not apply if foreign exchange exposure is hedged, as that is treated as a cash flow hedge. Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument is settled prematurely or matures or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. ANNUAL REPORT 2019 121 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the consolidated financial statements Cash flow hedge accounting In the case of cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the gain or loss on a hedging instrument is recognized directly in equity. The ineffective portion is recognized through profit or loss. Amounts that are recognized directly in equity are reclassified to profit or loss in the period in which the hedged item affects the net profit or loss for the period. Where the hedged item is the cost of a non-­ financial asset or non-financial liability, the amounts taken to equity are transferred to the initial carrying amount of the non-financial asset or non-financial liability. If the forecast transaction is no ­longer expected to occur, any amounts previously taken to equity are reclassified to the net profit or loss for the period. When the hedge is settled prematurely or matures, the amounts previously disclosed remain a separate item in equity until the forecast transaction occurs. The same applies if the hedging instrument is exercised without replacement or rollover, or if the criteria for cash flow hedge accounting are no longer in place. If the forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the amount is recognized through profit or loss. Further explanations on derivative financial instruments are given in note 41. Other financial assets Other financial assets include non-current investments in equity instruments. Other investments include shares in entities that are classified as at fair value through profit or loss or through other comprehensive income. Also included are non-consolidated entities­ that are included in the consolidated financial statements at cost on grounds of immateriality. Inventories Inventories of materials and supplies, work in process from the manufacture of standard machines and finished goods and merchandise are recognized at the lower of cost or net realizable value at the end of the reporting period. As a rule, an average value is used. Write-downs are recorded for obsolete and slow-moving inventories. Costs of conversion comprise direct materials costs, direct labor costs as well as an appropriate portion of production-related overheads and depreciation. The overhead markups are determined on the basis of average capacity utilization. Borrowing costs are included, provided that they relate to qualifying assets. Contract assets For the Dürr Group, contract assets represent a legal right to consideration in exchange for goods or services that are subject to conditions other than the simple term of payment. To the extent that costs have been incurred on contracts, but the amounts cannot yet be billed under the terms of the contracts as the payment right is still conditional, they are reported as contract assets together with the corresponding estimated earnings. The contract assets contain directly allocable contract costs as well as, to an appropriate degree, production-related overheads and estimated earnings that can be derived from the agreed transaction price. In order to adequately portray the credit risk of the respective customer, a corresponding valuation allowance is recognized in accordance with IFRS 9. The valuation allowance is determined using the same methods as for trade receivables. Trade receivables and other non-derivative financial assets Receivables and other non-derivative financial assets constitute a contractual right to receive cash or another financial asset at a future point of time. Receivables and non-derivative financial assets are carried at amortized cost less valuation allowances and impairments. To determine the valuation allowances and impairments the Group assesses the recoverability of the financial assets by referring to a number of factors. For this purpose, credit risks are segmented using common credit risk characteristics. A central monitoring and local collection management system counters the risk of bad debts. This system includes regular credit ratings, the conclusion of credit insurance policies and - particularly in the export business - issuing letters of credit. Further information on valuation allowances and impairments can be found in the section on the ­valuation and impairment of financial assets. 122 ANNUAL REPORT 2019 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the consolidated financial statements Other assets Other assets comprise capitalized assets that cannot be allocated to any other category. Costs of obtaining a contract that have arisen in connection with customer contracts are recognized at the amount incurred under other assets. Usually, the contractually agreed commission is a percentage­ of the contract value. This is only based on judgment to a small degree. Only in some cases the amount of the commission is variable and depends on the estimated gross margin of the contract. The costs of obtaining a contract are generally amortized in line with the percentage of completion of the underlying goods and services. For customer contracts that are invoiced when control is transferred, this occurs when the costs of obtaining a contract are written off entirely. Impairment losses on recognized costs of obtaining a contract are posted immediately to profit or loss if the residual carrying amount of the capitalized costs of obtaining a contract are higher than the remaining portion of consideration less costs that are directly in connection with delivering the goods or rendering the services and were not yet expensed. Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include cash, demand deposits and other short-term, highly liquid financial assets with an original term to maturity of less than three months. They are recognized at nominal­ value less valuation allowance. The credit risk rating is based on internal and external risk assessments. Further information on valuation allowance can be found in the section on the valuation and impairment of financial assets. Other comprehensive income This item presents changes in equity, including the deferred taxes thereon, other than those arising from capital transactions with owners (e.g., capital increases or distributions). These include exchange differences, accumulated actuarial gains and losses from the remeasurement of post-employment benefits and similar obligations as well as unrealized gains and losses from the measurement of financial assets and derivative financial instruments (cash flow hedges) measured at fair value. Borrowing costs Borrowing costs include interest and similar expenses, other finance costs and the cost of liabilities. Pursuant to IFRS 9\"Financial Instruments\", borrowing costs incurred in connection with the issue of the bond and Schuldschein loans are deducted on the liabilities' side of the consolidated statement of financial position. Calculated using the effective interest method, borrowing costs are amortized over the term of the bond and Schuldschein loans. Post-employment benefits The Group's post-employment benefits include defined contribution plans and defined benefit plans. The defined benefit plans guarantee the beneficiary a monthly old-age pension or non-recurring payment upon leaving the company. These benefit plans are funded by the entities as well as by the employees. In accordance with IAS 19\"Employee Benefits\", provisions for post-employment benefits are measured using the projected unit credit method. For this purpose, the future obligations are measured on the basis of the pro rata employee benefit obligations at the end of the reporting period. Provisions for post-employment benefit obligations are calculated taking into account development assumptions (e.g. relating to salary trends or pension increases) for those factors which affect the benefit amount. Defined benefit cost is divided into service cost and netinterest,­ which are recognized through profit or loss, and remeasurements, which are recognized directly in equity after deducting deferred taxes. Pursuant to the criteria of IAS 19, provisions for post-­ employment benefit obligations covered by assets held by a long- term benefit fund or by qualifying insurance policies are offset against the related plan assets, taking account of the asset ceiling. In addition to qualifying insurance policies, assets of an external insurance company or a fund are recognized as plan assets under IAS 19if these assets can be used exclusively to pay or fund employee benefits and are protected from potential creditors. ANNUAL REPORT 2019 123 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the consolidated financial statements Other provisions Other provisions are recorded pursuant to IAS 37\"Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets\" if the obligation to a third party results from a past event which is expected to lead to an outflow of economic benefits and can be reliably determined. Provisions for restructuring are recognized only to the extent that a detailed formal plan has been prepared and communicated to the parties concerned. Other provisions represent uncertain liabilities, which were recognized on the basis of a best estimate of the amount needed to settle the obligations. If the amount of the provision can only be determined within a range, the most probable figure is used. If there is no difference in the level of probability, the weighted average is taken. Provisions with a remaining term of more than one year are discounted at market interest rates which reflect the risk and period until the obligation is settled. Contract liabilities Contract liabilities constitute an obligation to the customer when progress billings issued and payments received from customers are collected or fall due before the promised service is rendered. Contract­ liabilities from progress billings issued and payments received from customers are offset against the services as soon as they are rendered. If a contract contains several separate performance obligations, only one contract asset or contract liability from this ­contract is determined on a net basis. Liabilities Trade payables and sundry financial liabilities are recorded at amortized cost. Other liabilities are recorded at the settlement amount. Liabilities that do not lead to an outflow of resources in the following year are discounted at market interest rates as of the end of the reporting period. At the inception of the lease, liabilities from leases are carried at the present value of the lease payments. Further information is ­contained in the section on leases. Income taxes and deferred taxes The Dürr Group operates in a large number of countries and is consequently subject to different tax jurisdictions. The anticipated ­current and deferred income taxes have to be determined for each taxable entity. Deferred taxes are accounted for using the balance sheet liability method according to IAS 12\"Income Taxes\". This involves creating­ deferred tax items for all temporary accounting and measurement differences between the carrying amounts for IFRSpurposes and the tax bases of the assets and liabilities. They are not created if the taxable temporary difference arises from goodwill or the initial recog­nition of other assets and liabilities in a transaction (that is not a business combination) which affects neither the IFRSaccounting profit nor the taxable profit or loss. Moreover, for leases where the Dürr Group is a lessee, already on the commencement date of the lease the Group recognizes: able that future taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences can be utilized, and A deferred tax asset is recognized for all taxable temporary differences arising from investments in subsidiaries or associates, and interests in joint ventures, unless the parent can control the reversal of the temporary difference and the temporary difference will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future. Further, deferred tax assets for future economic benefits from unused tax losses and unused tax credits are taken into account if it is highly probable that they will be used. Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are measured taking into account the respective local income tax rates which are expected to apply in the individual countries at the time of realization based on tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted. Deferred tax assets are reversed if it is more probable that the tax benefit will be forfeited than that it will be utilized. Deferred tax assets are recognized to the extent that they are likely to be used. The probability of their being used in the future is assessed taking into account various factors, such as future taxable profit in the planning periods, effects on earnings from the reversal of temporary differences, tax strategies and profit actually generated in the past. The Group uses a planning horizon of four years. Management reviews the deferred tax assets for utilization at the end of each reporting period. As these reviews are sometimes based on assumptions about the future, the actual values may diverge from 124 ANNUAL REPORT 2019 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the consolidated financial statements estimates. These are then adjusted through other comprehensive income or through profit or loss, depending on how they were initially recognized. Based on past experience and the expected future income, the Dürr Group assumes that the corresponding benefits will be realized from the deferred tax assets. Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are netted if, and only if, the entity has a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities and the deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied on the same taxable entity by the same taxation authority. Deferred taxes are recorded as tax income or expense in the statement of income unless they relate to items recorded through other comprehensive income; in this case, the deferred taxes are also recorded through other comprehensive income. Deferred tax assets from temporary differences in excess of deferred tax liabilities are only recognized to the extent that they can be utilized against future taxable profits. IFRIC 23\"Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments\", applicable from January 1, 2019, clarifies the accounting for uncertainties in income taxes. The probability with which the relevant tax authority with full knowledge of the matter will follow the position taken in the tax returns must be assessed. Particularly, judgment is required for the following uncertainties: ȖȖWhat are the potential effects of a deemed tax field audit? The Dürr Group examines continuously whether IFRIC 23needs to be applied to uncertain matters, primarily because the Group operates in a number of jurisdictions. Indications of uncertain tax treatments may be seen in the area of transfer pricing, which the Dürr Group intends to reduce through the application of the internal control system and documentation of transfer pricing. The Dürr Group, therefore, expects that it is probable that the tax authorities will accept the tax treatment of the Group. Share-based payment The share-based payment transactions pursuant to IFRS 2\"Share- based Payment\" cover remuneration systems that are settled in cash. For the measurement, the Dürr Group calculates the fair value of the share-based payment transactions upon initial recognition, at each reporting date and on the settlement date. The fair value is accumulated over the period through profit or loss until they are settled and recognized in sundry financial liabilities. Changes in fair value are recognized in personnel expenses in the statement of income. Contingent liabilities Contingent liabilities are possible obligations that arise from past events and whose existence will be confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the entity. Contingent liabilities can arise from a present obligation that results from past events but is not recognized because: economic­ benefits will be required to settle this obligation or A contingent liability is not disclosed if the possibility of an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits is remote; other- wise, information is provided in the notes to the financial state- ments. Contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are ­recognized at the acquisition date even if it is not probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. Use of assumptions and estimates The preparation of the consolidated financial statements pursuant to IFRSs requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the end of the reporting period and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting period. Actual figures may diverge from these estimates. ANNUAL REPORT 2019 125 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the consolidated financial statements The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the end of the reporting period that risk causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next reporting period are discussed below. Significant accounting judgments when applying IFRS 15 Determining the transaction price The transaction price is the amount of the consideration the Dürr Group expects to receive from its customers in exchange for transferring goods or rendering services. The transaction price of the individual performance obligations is determined using their stand-alone selling prices. The Group breaks down the trans­ action price agreed in the contract in proportion to the stand-alone ­selling prices. Variable consideration is only taken into account where it is highly probable that it will not result in a significant decrease in realized sales revenues once there is no longer any uncertainty in connection with the variable consideration. When determining­the transaction price, it must therefore be assessed whether the ­contractual arrangements provide for variable con- sideration. The Dürr Group has variable consideration in the form of discounts and rebate arrangements. Either the expected value method or the most likely amount method is used when estimating the variable consideration. The method used is the one with which the Group can provide­ the most reliable estimate of the con- sideration. The Group came to the conclusion that the most likely amount method is the most suitable method for estimating variable ­consideration. If it is assumed that a rebate will be granted upon concluding the contract, the transaction price is adjusted to the most likely amount. The same applies if it is expected upon concluding the contract that the customer will claim the discount. The most likely amount is ­calculated as the single most likely amount in a range of ­possible considerations. In determining the transaction price, the time value of money also needs to be ­considered if the timing of payments agreed to by the parties to the contract provides the customer (payment after receipt of goods or services) or the entity (payment before transfer of goods or ­services) with a significant­ benefit­ of financing the transfer of goods or services to the customer. In those cases where it is assumed upon initiating the contract that the period between customer payments and transfer of control over the asset is less than one year, the Group has decided to make use of the practical expedient not to adjust the transaction price for ­significant financing components. Determining the percentage of completion The majority of orders in the Dürr Group are accounted for using the percentage of completion method and sales revenues are recorded over time in accordance with the criteria of IFRS 15. A precise­ assessment of the degree of completion is essential for determining the percentage of completion using the PoC method. The key estimation parameters include total contract revenues and ­contract costs, the remaining costs of completion and the contract risks. These estimates are reviewed and adjusted regularly. As the PoC method and the ZPmethod are based on estimates, estimates of the expenses required for completion may have to be adjusted subsequently due to the uncertainties prevailing in this respect. Such adjustments to costs and income are recognized in the period in which the adjustments are determined. Provisions for onerous contracts are recognized at contract level and taken into account in the period in which the losses are identified; they are ­recognized as provisions pursuant to the requirements of IAS 37. Contract amendments Revenue recognition from the production and delivery of plant and machinery also takes into account amounts that the Group seeks to collect from customers or others for errors or changes in contract specifications or design, contract change orders in dispute or not yet negotiated as to both scope and price, or other customer-­related causes of unanticipated additional contract costs, claims and pending change orders. These are carried at the estimated amount provided their realization is highly probable and they can be reliably estimated. Pending change orders involve the use of estimates. Therefore, it is possible that adjustments to the estimated recoverable amounts of recorded pending change orders will be made in the future. Other accounting judgments Impairment of goodwill The Group tests goodwill for impairment at least once a year. This requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash-generating units to which the goodwill is allocated. To do this, management is required to make an estimate of the expected future cash flows from the cash-generating units. The Dürr Group uses a planning horizon of four years. In addition, it is necessary to choose a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value of these cash flows. Please refer to note 18for further details. 126 ANNUAL REPORT 2019 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the consolidated financial statements Leases Leases on buildings and office space in particular contain options to extend or terminate the lease. The measurement of the lease liability requires an estimate of whether it is reasonably certain that these options will be exercised. The Group takes into account all facts and circumstances that have an impact on these options being exercised or not. If the interest rate implicit in the lease cannot be determined, the incremental borrowing rate is used. This is derived for different terms of country-specific interest rate swaps and adjusted for a risk premium for leases. Valuation and impairment of financial assets During the recognition and measurement of financial­ assets, estimates­ and assumptions regarding the creditworthiness of ­debtors are necessary. Under the expected credit loss model, the measurement of valuation allowances for financial assets is subject to various assumptions and uncertainties. In particular, ­estimates are to be made about expected payment defaults, incoming payments and the collateral available. Please refer to note 41for further details. Pensions and other post-employment benefit plans The cost of defined benefit plans is determined using actuarial calculations. This involves making assumptions about discount rates, future salary increases, mortality rates and future pension increases (rate of pension progression). The mortality tables published by Heubeck AG(Heubeck 2018G) are used to determine the post-­employment benefit obligations. These tables are based on the most recent statistics from statutory pension insurance as well as the German Federal Statistics Office, and therefore reflect the most recent developments regarding life expectancy. The discount rates used are based on the market yields of high-quality,fixed-interest corporate bonds. The future pension increases in Germany follow the development in gross wages. In addition, the changes in the contribution rate in pension insurance and the development of the ratio of persons making contributions and pensioners are taken into account through sustainability factors. Due to the long-term nature of these plans, such assumptions are subject to significant uncer- tainty. Please refer to note 27for further details. Development costs Development costs are capitalized in accordance with the ­presented accounting policy. Determining the amounts to be capitalized requires management to make assumptions regarding the expected future cash generation of the assets, interest rates to be applied and the expected period of benefits. Options in connection with the domination and profit and loss transfer agreement with HOMAG Group AG Based on the domination and profit and loss transfer agreement that came into force in 2015, Dürr Technologies GmbH has the possibility to issue instructions to the corporate bodies of HOMAGGroup AGand to recognize the entire profit of HOMAGGroup AGas well as the obligation to absorb any losses. In return, the Dürr Group is required to make a compensation payment pursuant to Sec. 304AktG [\"Aktiengesetz\": German Stock Corporations Act] of € 1.18(gross) per HOMAGshare (€ 1.01(net) after deducting­ corporate income tax and solidarity surcharge; before individual tax burden­ of the shareholder) for each reporting period as well as a settle­ ment payment pursuant to Sec. 305AktG of € 31.56per HOMAGshare. Since then, Dürr Technologies GmbH has guaranteed a dividend equivalent to the compensation payment. The domination and profit and loss transfer agreement can be terminated­ for the first time as of December 31, 2020. In the prior period, Dürr Technologies GmbH acquired another 8.0%of the shares in HOMAGGroup AG. The call option granted for this purpose was exercised for the shareholder group Schuler/Klessmann on ­February 2, 2018. The total purchase price in this connection amounted to € 34,802thou- sand, which reduced sundry financial liabilities by € 32,756thou- sand. This transaction and further share deals in the 2019reporting period increased the share of Dürr Technologies GmbH in the subscribed capital of HOMAGGroup AGfrom 55.9%as of January 1, 2018to 64.0%as of December 31, 2019. On August 28, 2019, the Stuttgart Regional Court made a ­provisional decision in the arbitration proceedings initiated by the share­ holders of HOMAGGroup AG, and ruled that the settlement for shareholders of HOMAGGroup AGshould be raised from € 31.56to € 31.58. The Stuttgart Regional Court also decided that the compensation payment should be raised from € 1.18to € 1.19(gross) per HOMAGshare (after deducting corporate income tax and solidarity surcharge from € 1.01to € 1.03(net); before individual tax ­burden of the shareholder). Due to an appeal filed against the Stutt- gart Regional Court's decision, the ruling has not become effective. ANNUAL REPORT 2019 127 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the consolidated financial statements The decision of the Stuttgart Regional Court led to an increase of For further information on the recognition of the sundry financial liability for the obligation to acquire shares as well as to pay the compensation claims in connection with the domination and profit and loss transfer agreement concluded withHOMAGGroup AG, please refer to note 32. Share-based payment The measurement of cash-settledshare-based payment transactions is based on the anticipated share price at the end of the contractual term and earnings ratios over the duration of the program. Historical share prices are used to determine the fair value. The earnings ratios used are based on internal forecasts. The actual share prices and earnings ratios may deviate from the assumptions made. Estimates and assumptions are also required for the recognition and measurement of contingent liabilities and other provisions; the same applies to determining the fair value of long-lived items of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets. Notes to the items of the ­consolidated financial statements Notes to the consolidated ­statement of income Due to the first-time application ofIFRS 16, the amounts for \"amor- tization and depreciation of non-current assets\" in the cost of sales, selling, general administrative expenses and research and development costs also contain depreciation of capitalized right-of-use assets since the 2019reporting period.

INCOME TA XES The income taxes relate to the German corporate income tax including a solidarity surcharge, trade tax on income and comparable­ taxes levied at foreign subsidiaries. The current taxes incurred by foreign subsidiaries are recognized at the tax rates and regulations of the respective national tax law. In Germany, deferred taxes are calculated using a tax rate of 28.7%(prior period: 28.7%). 3.24 -COMPOSITION OF THE INCOME TAX EXPENSE € k 2019 2018 CURRENT INCOME TAXES Income tax expense - Germany 9,733 27,265 Income tax expense - other countries 50,189 42,691 Adjustment for prior periods -845 -745 Total current income tax expense 59,077 69,211 DEFERRED TAXES Deferred tax income - Germany -14,444 -3,842 Deferred tax income - other countries -2,056 -12,255 Adjustment for prior periods 2,316 3,061 Total deferred tax income -14,184 -13,036 Total income tax expense 44,893 56,175 Table 3.25shows the reconciliation of theoretical income tax expense to the total income tax expense reported. For the 2019reporting period, German corporate income tax law provided for a statutory tax rate of 15.0%(prior period: 15.0%) plus the solidarity surcharge of 5.5%(prior period: 5.5%). The average trade tax burden amounted to 12.9%for the 2019reporting period (prior period: 12.9%). This means that the reconciliation is based on an overall tax rate in Germany of 28.7%(prior period: 28.7%).

In calculating the possibilities for utilizing tax losses, the Dürr Group uses a four-year planning horizon and takes into account the minimum taxation rule applicable in certain countries. Losses arising in Germany from the period prior to the tax group are not recognized. In sum, unused interest and tax losses amounted to € 145,329thousand (prior period: € 181,355thousand) as of December 31, 2019. Unused interest and tax losses for which no deferred tax assets were recognized came to € 122,202thousand (prior period: Other deductible temporary differences of € 1,689thousand were not recognized as of December 31, 2019(prior period: € 5,601thousand). In the 2019reporting period, effects recognized through other comprehensive income contained €-2,461thousand from the first-time application of IFRS 16. Without these effects, the amount would have been €-1,934thousand. In the prior period, effects recognized through other comprehensive income contained €-1,185thousand from the first-time application ofIFRS 9. Without these effects, the amount would have been €-545thousand. Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are netted if, and only if, the entity has a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities and the deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation ­authority on the same taxable entity. The income taxes and withholding taxes on distributable profits­ from subsidiaries are reported under deferred tax liabilities if it can be assumed that these profits will be subject to the corresponding taxation, or if there is a plan not to reinvest these profits per- manently. No deferred tax liabilities were recognized on temporary differences in connection with shares in subsidiaries and associates­ of € 449,986thousand (prior period: € 443,628thousand). Dürr assumes that no reserves will be distributed to the respective ­parent in the tax group while the consolidated tax group is in place. Income tax liabilities As of December 31, 2019, all income tax liabilities of € 48,467thousand were due within one year. At the end of the prior period, income tax liabilities of € 30,806thousand were due within one year and of ANNUAL REPORT 2019 133 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the consolidated financial statements Notes to the consolidated ­statement of financial position: assets 18. INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND PROPERT Y, PL ANT AND EQUIPMENT Details regarding the changes in the Group's intangible assets and property, plant and equipment are presented in the statement of changes in non-current assets in note 43. Amortization, depreciation and impairment Amortization, depreciation and impairment is shown in the statement of income in the cost of sales and functional costs. In connection with the strategic realignment of the environmental technology business, the Dürr Group discontinued its business with micro gas turbines in the prior period. This resulted in an impairment loss on capitalized development costs of € 10,421thousand in cost of sales. Intangible assets In addition to goodwill, intangible assets with an indefinite useful life also include brand names of € 50,733thousand (prior period: Impairment test for goodwill The goodwill acquired from business combinations is allocated to the cash-generating units for impairment testing. The Dürr Group has defined the divisions or business activities within its divisions as cash-generating units. These are Paint and Final Assembly Systems,­ Application Technology, Clean Technology Systems, Balancing and Assembly Products, and Woodworking Machinery and Systems. The calculation model is used in exactly the same way for all cash-­ generating units as the main parameters apply equally to all business activities. The recoverable amount of the cash-generating units is determined based on the value in use. The value in use of each of the business activities exceeded the net assets assigned to it. The calculation is based on cash flow forecasts for a planning period of four years. The pre-tax discount rate for the cash flow forecast ranged from 9.36%to 15.53%in the 2019reporting period (prior period: 10.80%to 13.65%). Cash flows after the four-year period are extrapolated using a growth rate of 1.0%(prior period: 1.0%) based on the long- term growth rate of the business activities. The Dürr Group tests goodwill for impairment at the end of each reporting period. Planned gross profit margins The planned gross profit margins are determined in the bottom-up planning of the Group's entities and business activities. They are based on the figures determined in the previous reporting periods taking anticipated price and cost developments as well as efficiency increases into account. Cost of capital (discount rate) The cost of capital is the weighted average cost of debt and equity before taxes. When calculating the cost of equity, a beta factor is taken into account, which is derived from capital market data and 3.27 -AMORTIZATION AND DEPRECIATION 2019 2018 Property, Total amorti­ Property, Total amorti­ € k Intangible plant and zation and Intangible plant and zation and assets equipment1 depreciation assets equipment depreciation Cost of sales -32,252 -46,497 -78,749 -29,332 -29,952 -59,284 Selling expenses -1,794 -9,143 -10,937 -1,806 -4,519 -6,325 General administrative expenses -1,006 -12,771 -13,777 -1,087 -6,185 -7,272 Research and development costs -2,633 -6,692 -9,325 -3,162 -6,543 -9,705 -37,685 -75,103 -112,788 -35,387 -47,199 -82,586 1 including right-of-use assets pursuant to IFRS 16 134 ANNUAL REPORT 2019 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the consolidated financial statements the capital structure of the companies used to benchmark the Dürr Group's cash-generating units. Borrowing costs are based on a base interest rate for government bonds and a mark-up derived from the credit rating of benchmark companies. Increase in the price of raw materials Future increases in the price of upstream products and raw materials needed in the Group are primarily derived from the expected increase in the prices of those commodities needed to manufacture­ the goods or materials. These, in turn, are determined from the forecast price indices of the countries from which the upstream products and raw materials are procured by the respective Group entities. Increase in wage and salary costs In the four-year plan, the German subsidiaries have assumed annual average salary increases of 2.5%p.a. from 2020onwards (prior period: 2.9%p.a. from 2019onwards). The foreign subsidiaries have all used the applicable local rate of increase for the ­respective planning period. Sensitivity analysis of goodwill Independent of the current economic situation and the expectations for the future, the Dürr Group conducted sensitivity analyses­ of the recoverability of the goodwill carried in its activities. The impact of the following scenarios was examined: 3.28 -DEVELOPMENT OF GOODWILL The sensitivity analyses revealed that, from today's perspective, no impairment loss needed to be recognized on goodwill in any of the business activities even under these assumptions. Development of goodwill Table 3.28shows the development of goodwill, broken down by division and business activity. Goodwill of € 49,129thousand is attributable to the acquisition of Megtec and Universal companies in the 2018reporting period, of € 105,719thousand is attributable to the acquisition of the HOMAGGroup in 2014and of € 11,192thousand to the acquisition of the iTACcompanies in 2015. From historical acquisitions, sales and restructuring, today € 98,453thousand is attributable to the acquisition of former Alstom companies and € 93,832thousand to the acquisition of the former Schenck Group. In connection with the new strategy of the final assembly tech­ nology business, it was decided that all final assembly activities should belong to the Paint and Final Assembly Systems division. Accordingly, the product business with measuring and assembly technology as well as filling technology for the automotiveindustry­ were transferred from the Measuring and Process Systems division and have been assigned to the Paint and Final Assembly Systems cash-generating unit since January 1, 2020. The impairment test revealed that no impairment needs to be recognized for goodwill. The change in goodwill from additions in the 2019reporting period is explained below.

The gross contractual value of the acquired receivables and other assets approximates their fair value. The adjustments mainly relate to intangible assets, where technological know-how, customer relationships, brand names and order backlog were recognized in the purchase price allocation. For property, plant and equipment, real estate was recognized at market value. Hidden reserves were also uncovered to a lesser extent under property, plant and equipment and inventories. No contingent liabilities were identified in the course of the first-time consolidation. 3.33 -ACQUISITION MEGTEC/UNIVERSAL: HIDDEN RESERVES IDENTIFIED IN ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS € k Fair value Technological know-how 5,287 Customer relationships 20,699 Order backlog 3,307 Brand names 1,969 31,262 The fair value of technological know-how and the brand name was measured using the relief from royalty method; the fair value of ­customer relationships and the order backlog was measured using the residual value method.

EQUIT Y ATTRIBUTABLE TO SHAREHOLDERS OF DÜRR AKTIENGESELLSCHAFT Subscribed capital (Dürr AG) As of December 31, 2019, the capital stock of Dürr AGcame to € 177,157thousand (prior period: € 177,157thousand) and was made up of 69,202,080no-par value shares (prior period: 69,202,080shares). In the prior period, bonus shares were issued in a ratio of 1:1to the existing shareholders in the course of a capital­ increase from company funds, during which part of the capital reserve of € 88,578thousand was converted into subscribed capital. Each share represents € 2.56of the subscribed capital and is made out to the bearer. The shares issued were fully paid in. Authorizations Authorization for acquisition and sale of treasury shares (Dürr AG) The annual general meeting on May 4, 2016authorized the Board of Management to purchase no-par value bearer shares once or several­ times until May 3, 2021. The purchases, whether for one or more purposes, may be transacted through the stock exchange or through a public tender addressed to all shareholders. The number of shares purchased in this way may not at any time exceed 10%of the capital stock. The authorization may not be used for the purpose of trading with treasury shares. In the event of the shares being purchased through the stock exchange or by public offer, the consideration for the purchase of the shares is not allowed to exceed or fall below the arithmetic mean of the price in the closing auction on the XETRAtrading system by more than 10%during the last ten trading days before the contractual transaction is concluded. If the acquisition takes place through a public invitation addressed to all shareholders­ for the submission of bids, the Company sets a range of purchase prices per share. The 10%threshold described above also applies here. The Board of Management, with the consent of the Super­visory Board, was also authorized to sell treasury shares under certain circumstances. In connection with this authori­ zation, the Board of Management was also granted the option, under ­certain circumstances, to exclude the shareholders' put option and subscription right. Authorized capital (Dürr AG) The annual general meeting on May 10, 2019authorized the Board of Management, subject to the approval of the Supervisory Board, to increase the capital stock once or several times in exchange for cash contributions and/or contributions in kind in the period up to May 9, 2024by up to € 53,147thousand by issuing up to 20,760,624no-par value shares made out to the bearer. The Board of Management was also authorized to preclude, subject to the approval of the Supervisory Board, the subscription right of the shareholders in certain cases. Conditional capital (Dürr AG) The annual general meeting on May 10, 2019authorized the Board of Management, subject to the approval of the Supervisory Board, to issue once or several times until May 9, 2024, bearer or registered convertible bonds, warrant-linked bonds, income bonds or combinations of these instruments with or without fixed maturity. For this purpose, the subscribed capital was ­conditionally increased by a maximum of € 17,716thousand by issue of up to 6,920,208new no-par value shares made out to the bearer. The Board of Management was also authorized, with the approval of the Supervisory Board, to preclude the subscription right of shareholders­ under certain circumstances and with defined limits. None of the three authorizations have been exercised to date. Capital reserve (Dürr AG) The capital reserve includes share premiums and amounted to € 67,318thousand as of December 31, 2019(prior period: Revenue reserves Revenue reserves contain the profits generated in the past by the entities included in the consolidated financial statements that have not been distributed. They totaled € 820,820thousand as of Decem- ber 31, 2019(prior period: € 771,468thousand). The change is chiefly owing to the addition of the result for the year, the recognition and measurement of options allocable to non-controlling interests and the distribution of the dividend for the 2018fiscal year. An amount of €-9,415thousand was attributable to the adjustment of revenue reserves in connection with the accounting pursuant to IFRS 16\"Leases\". 144 ANNUAL REPORT 2019 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the consolidated financial statements Restriction on distribution, transfer and withdrawal in the separate financial statements of Dürr AG (Sec. 253 (6) HGB) Due to the legal regulations on the measurement of provisions in the separate financial statements of Dürr AGprepared in accordance with the German commercial law, there are restrictions on distri- bution. A difference of € 807thousand (prior period: € 931thousand) arises from the recognition of provisions according to the respective average market interest rate from the past ten reporting periods and from the recognition of provisions according to the respective ­average market interest rate from the past seven reporting periods; this amount is also subject to a restriction on distribution. Dividends In accordance with the AktG, the distribution is measured based on net retained profit as reported by DürrAGin its separate financial statements prepared in accordance with the provisions of ­German commercial law. In the 2019reporting period, Dürr AGdistributed a dividend to its shareholders of € 1.00per share from the net retained profit recorded in 2018(prior period: € 2.20- based on 34,601,040shares). The total amount distributed came to Disclosures on capital management The primary objective of capital management is to support business­ operations, ensure a healthy capital ratio and increase business value. The Dürr Group monitors its capital on a monthly basis using a gearing ratio, which reflects the ratio of net financial debt to equity and is defined as the ratio of net financial debt to equity and net financial debt. Pursuant to the Group's internal policy, the ratio should not exceed 30%. The increase in lease liabilities due to the application of IFRS 16had a negative effect on the net financial debt and gearing ratio. As of December 31, 2019, it amounted to 8.7%(prior period: -3.4%), however, it was still significantly below the threshold. 3.52 -GEARING RATIO € k Dec. 31, 2019 Dec. 31, 2018 Cash and cash equivalents -662,024 -655,042 Time deposits and sundry financial receivables -161,792 -544 Bond and Schuldschein loans 798,242 597,958 Lease liabilities (IFRS 16)/ finance lease liabilities­ (IAS 17) 107,101 7,182 Other financial liabilities 17,724 18,141 Net financial debt 99,251 -32,305 Equity 1,043,386 992,151 Net financial debt 99,251 -32,305 Equity and net financial debt 1,142,637 959,846 Net financial debt 99,251 -32,305 Equity and net financial debt 1,142,637 959,846 Gearing ratio 8.7 % -3.4 % 27. PROVISIONS FOR POST-EMPLOYMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS The Group's post-employment benefits include defined contribution plans and defined benefit plans. Defined contribution plans In the case of defined contribution plans, the Dürr Group pays contributions to state or private insurance institutions. Other than the subsidiary liability of the employer regarding its company pension­ plans, there are no other legal or constructive obligations for the Dürr Group. A claim from the subsidiary liability is currently unlikely. The contributions are recognized when they fall due as a personnel expense within the functional costs. The post-employment benefits available to the employees of the German entities of the Dürr Group include a life insurance program in line with the respective tariff group, for which the Group recognized contributions of € 910thousand (prior period: € 875thou- sand) as an expense. In addition, the Group paid contributions of ANNUAL REPORT 2019 145 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the consolidated financial statements The USsubsidiaries contribute to external pension funds for trade union employees. In the 2019reporting period, pension expenses for these employees amounted to € 4,485thousand (prior period: In addition, the USsubsidiaries of the Group have a \"401(k)\" profit-­sharing plan for certain employees. Profit-sharing is based on the years of service and the employees' remuneration. The Dürr Group's contribution is discretionary and is determined ­annually by management­. In the 2019reporting period, expenses came to around € 2,638thousand (prior period: € 2,164thousand). Defined benefit plans Pension entitlements have been granted to individual former members of the Board of Management of Dürr AGand the members of the management board and general managers of German subsidi­ aries based on their most recent fixed salary and years of service. Some non-pay-scale employees of the German subsidiaries of the Dürr Group, including the members of the Board of Management of Dürr AG, Carl Schenck AGand HOMAGGroup AG, are also offered the possibility to convert employee contributions into a benefit obligation in addition to ongoing employer contributions (pension plan of the Dürr Group). Under these plans, Dürr employees are ­entitled to convert certain parts of their future pay into an entitlement to future supplementary company benefits. To secure and finance the resulting obligations, the Dürr Group has taken out employer's pension­ liability insurance for the life of the beneficiaries or invests to a small extent in balanced funds comprising shares and bonds. The Dürr Group has the exclusive right to the respective benefits. This therefore does not represent any significant actuarial or investment risk for the Dürr Group. The amount of post-­employment ­benefits equals the benefit paid out under the employer'spension­ liability insurance concluded by the company, which consists of a guaranteed pension and the divisible surplus allocated by the insurance company. For the funds investment, the benefits paid out later correspond to the balance of the fund. The Dürr Group reports the benefit obligations net of assets. At the German entities of the Dürr Group, those employees who were employed at the Schenck entities at the time of the takeover were entitled to post-employment benefits. These are based on years of service. The payments provided for by the pension plans comprise fixed amounts plus an element that is dependent on years of service. A USentity has a pension plan covering all non-union employees at that subsidiary. This plan was closed in 2003and the claims for active members were frozen. The amount of the future pension ­benefits is based on the average salaries earned and length of service­ before the pension entitlements were frozen in 2003. A subsidiary in the UShas an approximate 37%share in a multi-­ employer plan which is maintained jointly with other non-affiliatedmetal-working companies. The defined benefit plan is accounted for as a defined contribution plan as it is not possible to allocate the share of obligations and plan assets to the individual member companies. The beneficiaries of the plan are members of a trade union. The contributions are calculated on the basis of the number of production hours worked by members. A temporary shortfall in capacity utilization as well as lower returns on plan assets meant there has been a deficit in the past. There was no longer a deficit from March 31, 2018. For 2019, the Group expects contributions of Moreover, there are plans that provide for payouts when employees leave the company as well as further minor pension plans. Post-employment benefit plan participants and risk management Provisions for post-employment benefits are recognized for obligations from future and current post-employment benefits to eligible­ current and former employees as well as their surviving depen- dents. Pension plans vary according to local legal, tax and economic conditions and are usually based on employees' years of service as well as their remuneration. In the 2019reporting period there were obligations in place for 3,772eligible persons (prior period: 3,227), thereof 3,154active employees (prior period: 2,650), 172former employees with vested rights (prior period: 116) as well as 446retired employees and surviving dependents (prior period: 461). 146 ANNUAL REPORT 2019 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the consolidated financial statements The defined benefit plans are largely financed via provisions which have corresponding qualifying fund assets as plan assets that are offset against the obligations. The plan assets mostly exist in the form of employer's pension liability insurance policies pledged to beneficiaries. In order to take adequate account of risks associated with post-­ employment benefit obligations, the Dürr Group established the Corporate Pension Committee (CPC) several years ago. This committee convenes regularly and reviews and assesses all global Development of defined benefit plans post-employment benefit plans within the Dürr Group. Regular participants of the CPCare the Chief Financial Officer of Dürr AGas well as the heads of the central functional areas Human Resources, Accounting & Controlling, Treasury and Legal. Furthermore, to minimize the risk from pension obligations, no new defined benefit pensions have been granted in Germany for ­several years if their value is largely not hedged by external counter-­ financing. At the same time, the current pension plans are largely financed through deferred compensation. 3.53 -CHANGES IN THE PRESENT VALUE OF DEFINED BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS € k Dec. 31, 2019 Dec. 31, 2018 Defined benefit obligation at the beginning of the year 125,697 116,739 Exchange difference 446 876 Current service cost 3,670 3,488 Past service cost 142 554 Interest expenses 2,438 1,638 Remeasurement of the defined benefit obligation 12,554 162 thereof actuarial gains and losses from changes in demographic assumptions -222 750 thereof actuarial gains and losses from changes in financial assumptions 12,181 -872 thereof experience adjustments 595 284 Employee contributions 1,893 1,875 Benefits paid -6,956 -5,148 Changes in the consolidated group - 5,728 Other 529 -215 Defined benefit obligation at the end of the year 140,413 125,697 ANNUAL REPORT 2019 147 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the consolidated financial statements 3.54 -CHANGE IN PLAN ASSETS € k Dec. 31, 2019 Dec. 31, 2018 Fair value of plan assets at the beginning of the year 77,205 68,340 Exchange difference 333 459 Interest income 1,653 839 Income from plan assets excluding amounts contained in net interest 1,688 5,205 Employer contributions 3,884 3,344 Employee contributions 1,893 1,875 Benefits paid -4,377 -2,890 Changes in the consolidated group - 172 Other 151 -139 Fair value of plan assets at the end of the year 82,430 77,205 Effect of asset ceiling -930 -1,592 Plan assets taking into account the asset ceiling 81,500 75,613 Funded status 1 58,913 50,084 3.55 -FUNDED STATUS € k Dec. 31, 2019 Dec. 31, 2018 Present value of funded benefit obligations 132,271 113,832 Plan assets taking into account the asset ceiling 81,500 75,613 Defined benefit obligation in excess of plan assets 50,771 38,219 Present value of non-funded benefit obligations 8,142 11,865 Funded status 1 58,913 50,084 1difference between the present value of the defined benefit obligation and the plan assets, taking­ into account the asset ceiling At the end of the reporting period, the fair value of plan assets breaks down as shown in table 3.57. 3.56 -ITEMS OF THE STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION FOR ACCOUNTING FOR POST-EMPLOYMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS € k Dec. 31, 2019 Dec. 31, 2018 Provisions for post-employment benefit obligations 58,962 50,084 Other assets 49 - 58,913 50,084 3.57 -COMPOSITION OF PLAN ASSETS € k Dec. 31, 2019 Dec. 31, 2018 Employer's pension liability insurance 64,515 65,943 Fixed-interest securities 13,822 9,968 Shares 2,147 828 Real estate 1,729 138 Other 217 328 82,430 77,205 The plan assets of the German entities mainly consist of employer's pension liability insurance policies which guarantee the amount. These employer's pension liability insurance policies have been invested mainly in fixed-interest securities. When selecting the issu- ers, the factors considered include the individual rating by inter­ national agencies and the equity capitalization of the issuers. The aim of the investment strategy is long-term capital accumu­lation on the one hand, and ongoing interest income on the other. This leads to slightly greater volatility. As part of a balanced approach, the portfolio mix contains debt and equity securities. The long- term growth in plan assets should be achieved primarily by means of fixed-interest securities which will also secure ongoing interest income. Equity instruments also make up a share of the investment portfolio. With the exception of shares, fixed-interest securities and real estate, there are no listed prices on an active market. Where ­employer's pension liability insurance belongs to plan assets as qualifying insurance policies and exactly match the benefits, the present value of the covered obligations applies as their fair value. Otherwise, the fair value of plan assets is generally calculated on the basis of the market expectations prevailing on that date. The expenses for defined benefit plans recognized through profit or loss comprise the items listed in table 3.58. 148 ANNUAL REPORT 2019 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the consolidated financial statements 3.58 -SHARE OF EXPENSES FROM DEFINED BENEFIT PLANS RECOGNIZED THROUGH PROFIT OR LOSS € k 2019 2018 Current service cost 3,670 3,488 Past service cost 142 554 Net interest expenses 825 823 Other 23 -268 4,660 4,597 The asset ceiling resulted in a change of € 638thousand (prior period: € 51thousand) in total comprehensive income. Of this amount, € 689thousand (prior period: € 75thousand) was recognized directly in equity and €-51thousand (prior period: €-24thou- sand) through profit or loss. The reporting date for the measurement of projected benefit obligations and plan assets is December 31; the measurement date for defined benefit plans is January1. In addition to the assumptions on life expectancy based on the Heubeck 2018G biometric mortality tables for the German Group companies, the rates in table 3.59were used as a basis for calculating the defined benefit obligations and the fair value of the plan assets. The application of the new mortality tables for the German pension obligations caused the present value of the defined benefit obligation to increase by 2019 2018 % Germany Rest of world Germany Rest of world Discount rate 0.70 1.51 1.70 2.40 Long-term salary increases 3.00 1.69 3.00 2.00 The rate of pension progression, which has a significant impact on the defined benefit obligations as of the end of the reporting period, came to 1.75%in the 2019reporting period (prior period: 1.75%). The average rates are calculated on the basis of the weighted average of the defined benefit obligations. The average duration of the post-employment benefit obligations as of the end of the 2019reporting period was 10years, the average duration of the post-employment benefit obligations from the Dürr Group's pension scheme was 18years. For the 2020reporting period, employers are expected to make contributions of Table 3.60gives an overview of the payments for defined benefit plans expected in the coming reporting periods. Sensitivity analyses The material actuarial assumptions for the valuation of post-­ employment benefit obligations are the discount rate and, for ­obligations in Germany, also the rate of pension progression. By hedging the significant risks with employer's pension liability insurance policies, the longevity risk for the obligations in Germany plays only a minor role. Table 3.61shows how the defined benefit obligation is influenced by potential changes to the respective assumptions using sensitivity­ analyses. 3.61 -SENSITIVITIES - CHANGES IN THE DEFINED BENEFIT OBLIGATION € k Dec. 31, 2019 Dec. 31, 2018 DISCOUNT RATE +1 percentage point -12,556 -10,332 -1 percentage point 15,676 12,791 RATE OF PENSION PROGRESSION +0.25 percentage points 2,366 1,994 -0.25 percentage points -2,260 -1,910 3.60 -EXPECTED PAYMENTS FROM THE DEFINED BENEFIT PLANS € k 2020 2021 2022 2023 Expected payments from the defined benefit plans 6,308 6,751 6,457 6,530 2024 2025 to 2029 6,524 32,847 Total 65,417 ANNUAL REPORT 2019 149 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the consolidated financial statements There are dependencies between the actuarial assumptions.

OTHER PROVISIONS Table 3.62 The contract-related provisions mainly consist of provisions for after-sales expenses, warranties and for onerous contracts in the order backlog. Around 66%(prior period: 61%) of the contract-­ related provisions relate to provisions for warranties and after- sales expenses. The calculation of the contract-related provisions is largely based on after-sales expenses that are still expected as well as on statutory or contractual warranty claims and was performed using past experience and taking current circumstances into account. The personnel provisions mainly contain obligations for the phased retirement scheme and provisions for long-­service awards. These provisions are derived from actuarial investigation­ procedures. Sundry provisions relate to various identifiable specific­ risks and uncertain liabilities for which there is uncertainty as to the date and future costs and for which the amount can be ­estimated reliably. As of December 31, 2019, other provisions mainly include provisions for optimization measures in the Woodworking ­Machinery and Systems division (HOMAGGroup). Those other provisions that are expected to be used within the next twelve months are classified as current. The payments for non-­ current provisions are expected to be incurred within the next two to five years. Table 3.63 29. CONTR ACT LIABILITIES Contract liabilities constitute obligations for the Dürr Group to transfer goods or services to a customer for which the customer has already paid or to which the customer has a claim. This relates to contracts for which customer payments received or due exceed the ­project status.

In most cases a customer payment is already due before work commences. This results in the customer having to prefinance the project in the ordinary course of business. During the project, further payments are invoiced based on project milestones reached. In the 2019reporting period, there were no ­notable deviations from this typical relationship between performance and customer payment. This is reflected in the disclosure of the ­balance as a contract liability. In the prior period, the acquisition of Megtec/Universal entities had an impact on the contract assets of € 19,149thousand and of € 16,622thousand on contract liabilities. Other than this, there were no significant changes to the balances from contract assets and liabilities. 30. TR ADE PAYABLES Table 3.64 31.

The funds were received on April 6, 2016. The total volume is split into three tranches with terms of five, seven and ten years. The average interest rate amounts to around 1.6%p.a. for tranches with both fixed and variable interest terms. The Schuldschein loan was arranged by Commerzbank AG, Landesbank Baden-Württem- berg and ­UniCredit Bank AGand signed by numerous banks both within and outside of Germany. The funds serve to generally fund the Group and to strengthen strategic liquidity. On June 19, 2019, the Dürr Group placed a sustainability Schuld- schein loan of € 200,000thousand. The payment of interest is partly coupled­ with the sustainability rating of the Dürr Group. The ­average ­interest rate for the Schuldschein loan is 0.84%p.a. Dürr AGreceived the funds on July 4, 2019and they are split into tranches with terms of five, six, eight and ten years. The Schuldschein loan strengthens the liquidity and will be used for long-term corporate financing. In ­addition, the Schuldschein loan serves as early follow -up financing for the ­corporate bond expiring in 2021. Syndicated loan As part of its sustainability oriented refinancing, Dürr AGconcluded a syndicated loan of € 750,000thousand on July 25, 2019, and on its effective date August 7, 2019, replaced the existing syndicated loan from 2014prematurely. The new syndicated loan is split into a cash line of € 500,000thousand and a bank guarantee­ of € 250,000thousand. 13banks from Europe, Asia and the USAbelong to the syndicate. BNPParibas S.A., Commerzbank AG, DeutscheBank AGand UniCredit Bank AGare responsible for coordinating the syndicate. The payment of interest of the new loan depends, among other things, on the sustainability rating of the Dürr Group. When the interest rate is coupled with the sustainability rating prepared by EcoVadis, the interest rate falls or rises according to certain sustainability criteria. Many factors are considered, for example, environmental indicators such as CO2emissions and water consump- tion, as well as fair working conditions and supplier practices. The syndicated loan does not include any collateral on fixed and current assets. The new loan enlarges the financial headroom of the Dürr Group. It is intended for general corporate financing (cash line) and to cover other obligations from the mechanical and plant engineering vis a vis third parties (bank guarantee). The term has been agreed until July 25, 2024, however, it can be extended twice by one year each with the approval of the banks. The consortium loan facility arranged in 2014(€ 250,000thousand cash line, € 215,000thousand bank guarantee), which would have been due in 2021, was repaid by Dürr AGon August 7, 2019, without loan prepayment penalties. The syndicate of banks comprised Baden-Württembergische Bank, Commerzbank AG, Deutsche Bank AG, UniCredit Bank AG, HSBCTrinkaus & Burkhardt AG, BNPParibas and KfW IPEX-Bank GmbH. The syndicated loan did not include any collateral on fixed and current assets and was intended for general corporate financing. The agreed financial covenant was complied with on all the specified measurement dates. Interest on the syndicated loan was payable at the matching ­refinancing rate plus a variable margin.

Lease liabilities amounted to € 107,101thousand as of Decem- ber 31, 2019. In the prior period, lease liabilities from finance leases of € 7,182thousand were included in financial liabilities. The leases mainly have terms of between one year and ten years, in some cases the contracts have a term of more than 15years. Potential cash outflows of € 32,573thousand are not included in the lease liabilities as it is not reasonably certain that the extension options will be exercised. Variable lease payments of € 242thousand were recognized through profit or loss. To a small extent, the contracts contain price adjustment clauses based on consumer price indices. Any potential adjustments in lease payments arising as a result are not taken into account in the lease liability. 32.

SHARE-BASED PAYMENT There is a share-basedlong-term incentive (LTI) program in place for the members of the Board of Management of Dürr AGand top level management of the Dürr Group. The program takes the form of tranches that are issued every year and have a term of three years each. The payments will be made upon expiry of the contractual term in each case after the following annual general meeting. Under the program, the beneficiaries receive an individually fixed number of phantom Dürr shares (performance share units). As of December 31, 2019, 239,250phantom shares had been issued (prior period: 254,250shares). At the end of the term of the incentive pro- gram, the benefits accrued are settled in cash. The settlement is calculated on the number of phantom shares, the rounded share price on the closing date (share price multiplier) and an EBITmultiplier based on the average EBITmargin generated over the term of the arrangement. There is a cap for the EBITmultiplier. Payment is capped individually in each case.

In order to make the fair value measurement of financial instruments comparable, a fair value hierarchy has been established in IFRSs with the following three levels: 156 ANNUAL REPORT 2019 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the consolidated financial statements The financial instruments measured at fair value by the Dürr Group break down as follows according to the fair value hierarchy levels: 3.70 -ALLOCATION TO THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY LEVELS Fair value hierarchy € k Dec. 31, 2019 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 ASSETS AT FAIR VALUE - NOT THROUGH PROFIT OR LOSS Other financial assets 3,306 - - 3,306 Derivatives used for hedging 2,820 - 2,820 - ASSETS AT FAIR VALUE - THROUGH PROFIT OR LOSS Other financial assets 9,347 - - 9,347 Sundry financial assets 19,507 - - 19,507 Derivatives not used for hedging 630 - 630 - Derivatives used for hedging 357 - 357 - LIABILITIES AT FAIR VALUE - NOT THROUGH PROFIT OR LOSS Obligations from options 33,189 - - 33,189 Derivatives used for hedging 2,141 - 2,141 - LIABILITIES AT FAIR VALUE - THROUGH PROFIT OR LOSS Obligations from options 1,610 - - 1,610 Liabilities from contingent purchase price installments 552 - - 552 Derivatives not used for hedging 1,059 - 1,059 - Derivatives used for hedging 544 - 544 - Fair value hierarchy Dec. 31, 2018 € k Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 ASSETS AT FAIR VALUE - NOT THROUGH PROFIT OR LOSS Other financial assets 2,306 - - 2,306 Derivatives used for hedging 2,163 - 2,163 - ASSETS AT FAIR VALUE - THROUGH PROFIT OR LOSS Other financial assets 7,880 - - 7,880 Sundry financial assets 19,512 5 - 19,507 Derivatives not used for hedging 623 - 623 - Derivatives used for hedging 905 - 905 - LIABILITIES AT FAIR VALUE - NOT THROUGH PROFIT OR LOSS Obligations from options 37,239 - - 37,239 Derivatives used for hedging 4,775 - 4,775 - LIABILITIES AT FAIR VALUE - THROUGH PROFIT OR LOSS Obligations from options 570 - - 570 Liabilities from contingent purchase price installments 9,532 - - 9,532 Derivatives not used for hedging 1,124 - 1,124 - Derivatives used for hedging 1,674 - 1,674 - ANNUAL REPORT 2019 157 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the consolidated financial statements As of the end of each reporting period, an assessment is made as to whether there were reclassifications between the different hierarchy levels or measurement categories. No reclassifications were made between the fair value hierarchy levels or measurement categories in the 2019reporting period. Measurement at fair value of the financial instruments of levels 1, 2and 3held as of December 31, 2019gave rise to the following total gains and losses: 3.71 -TOTAL GAINS AND LOSSES ON ASSETS € k 2019 2018 RECOGNIZED IN PROFIT OR LOSS Investments in equity instruments measured at -478 fair value through profit or loss 1,467 Derivative financial instruments 2,507 1,492 RECOGNIZED IN EQUITY Derivative financial instruments 1,246 2,171 3.72 -TOTAL GAINS AND LOSSES ON LIABILITIES € k 2019 2018 RECOGNIZED IN PROFIT OR LOSS Liabilities from contingent purchase price installments 50 -87 Obligations from options -1,040 1,129 Derivative financial instruments -2,600 -2,792 RECOGNIZED IN EQUITY Obligations from options 4,050 -761 Derivative financial instruments -568 -3,650 3.73 -DEVELOPMENT OF LEVEL 3 OF THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY OF ASSETS € k 2019 2018 As of December 31, prior period 29,693 19,507 Adjustments IFRS 9 - 10,795 As of January 1 29,693 30,302 Changes in the consolidated group - -132 Exchange difference - 1 Additions 1,000 - Disposals - - Change in fair value 1,467 -478 As of December 31 32,160 29,693 With the introduction of IFRS 9, other investments and non-consolidated Group entities in the category were reclassified to the fair value category and taken into account in the opening balance. The changes in the fair value of the assets reported in level 3were reported in the investment result through profit or loss. 3.74 -DEVELOPMENT OF LEVEL 3 OF THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY OF LIABILITIES € k 2019 2018 As of December 31, prior period 47,341 44,957 Adjustments IFRS 9 - 1,699 As of January 1 47,341 46,656 Additions - 1,196 Disposals -8,930 -230 Change in fair value -3,060 -281 As of December 31 35,351 47,341 Valuation techniques The fair value of the derivative financial assets and liabilities allocated to level 2of the fair value hierarchy is based on daily observable spot foreign exchange rates and interest yield curves. In connection with IFRS 13\"Fair Value Measurement\", both the counterparty­ credit risk and own risk of default have been taken into account during measurement. Input factors to take into account for the counterparty credit risk are credit default swaps (CDSs), observable on the markets, of the credit institution involved in the respective 158 ANNUAL REPORT 2019 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the consolidated financial statements 3.75 -FAIR VALUES OF INVESTMENTS IN EQUITY INSTRUMENTS AND OPTIONS Dec. 31, 2019 Dec. 31, 2018 Carrying Carrying amount Sensitivity analysis amount Sensitivity analysis € k +10 % -10 % +10 % -10 % ADAMOS GmbH 3,000 3,215 2,652 2,000 2,154 1,914 HOMAG eSolution GmbH -Option 1,440 1,297 1,584 1,196 1,243 1,148 Parker Engineering Co., Ltd. 9,347 10,032 8,661 7,880 8,445 7,315 SBS Ecoclean GmbH 19,507 19,507 19,507 19,507 19,507 19,507 transaction. If there is no CDSfor a single credit institution, a synthetic CDSis derived from other observable market data (such as rating information). The counterparty credit risk is minimized by diversifying the portfolio and selecting the counterparties carefully. To calculate its own risk of default, the Dürr Group uses information received from credit institutions and insurance companies to derive a synthetic CDSfor the Group. The fair value of the options, contingent purchase price installments and other financial assets allocated to level 3in the fair value hierarchy is calculated based on contractual arrangements or internal­ data. This primarily includes historical results, accounting data and forward-looking planning data of each company on which the amount of the financial liabilities depends. The fair value of ­financial assets is derived from contractual arrangements of a selling­ price and a fixed interest component. The assumptions are regularly reviewed and adjusted if necessary. If applicable, ­unwinding effects resulting from a convergence with the maturity date are also included in the valuation. Sensitivity level 3 The fair value of ADAMOSGmbH is primarily based on the free cash flows expected for the coming years. The measurement of the option for the acquisition of further shares of HOMAGeSolution GmbH is based on the distributable capital of future years until 2021and interest-bearing purchase price. The calculation of the fair value of Parker Engineering Co., Ltd. is largely based on estimates by management on the development of the future free cash flows of the company. The value of the related put option is based on the company's pro rata equity and would fluctuate upward or downward in the event of an assumed change of 10%. In connection with the sale of the Cleaning and Surface Processing business activity in 2017, the Dürr Group received a 15%investment in the holding company SBSEcoclean GmbH with registered offices in Stuttgart, Germany. The buyer, Shenyang Blue Silver Industry Automation Equipment Co., exercised the option to acquire the remaining 15%of the investment in SBSEcoclean GmbH from the Dürr Group. For calculating the fair value of the 15%investment in SBSEcoclean GmbH, the Group does not currently expect any performance-related contractual clauses that may have a positive impact on the value to apply. From investments held in the portfolio, dividends of € 132thousand were recognized in the 2019reporting period. Fair values of financial instruments carried at amortized cost Table 3.76shows the fair value of the financial assets and lia­ bilities carried at cost or amortized cost. The fair value of ­financial instruments not carried at amortized cost approximates their carrying amount.

Consequently, their ­carrying amounts at the end of the reporting period approximate their fair value. The fair value of non-current liabilities is based on the current interest rate for borrowing at similar terms and conditions with comparable due date and credit rating. With the exception of the bond, the Schuldschein loans and the obligations from options, the fair value of liabilities approximates the carrying amount. The fair value of the bond (fair value hierarchy level 1) is calculated by multiplying the nominal value with the quoted price at the end of the reporting period. As of December 31, 2019, the bond was quoted at 102.94%(prior period: 104.75%), which is equal to a market value of € 308,820thousand (prior period: € 314,250thousand). The fair value of the Schuldschein loans (fair value hierarchy level 2) and finance lease liabilities (2018, fair value hierarchy level 2), is determined by discounting the cash flows as of the measurement date with discount rates with matching terms. The obligations from options measured at amortized cost (level 3in the fair value hierarchy) relate to the sundry financial liabilities recognized under the domination and profit and loss transfer agreement with HOMAGGroup AGfor the acquisition of shares as well as to pay the compensation entitlements. The sundry financial liabilities are recognized through profit or loss in the subsequent measurement. The expected term of the arbitration proceedings as well as the expected amount of the compensation payment and cash settlement­ determine the measurement of the option. The expected term of the arbitration proceedings remains unchanged on the prior period. Due to an initial ruling of the Stuttgart Regional Court, which is not yet legally binding, the expected compensation payment was raised from € 1.01to € 1.03(net) and the expected cash settlement from € 31.56to € 31.58. The fair value is determined using 160 ANNUAL REPORT 2019 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the consolidated financial statements a net present value model based on the cash settlement including compensation payment as well as the legal minimum interest rate and a discount rate with a matching term. The difference between the fair value and the carrying amount is due to the fact that the fair value takes into account changes in the actual interest rate environ- ment, while the discount rate used for measurement at amortized cost remains mostly unchanged over the term.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS The consolidated statement of cash flows shows how the cash and cash equivalents changed in the 2019reporting period as a result of cash received and paid and thus provides information on the sources and use of cash and cash equivalents. The consolidated statement of cash flows prepared in accordance with IAS 7\"Statement of Cash Flows\" makes a distinction between the cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities. The cash presented in the statement of cash flows contains all of the Group's cash and cash equivalents, i.e., cash in hand, checks and bank balances, with an original term to maturity of less than three months. The valuation allowance to be recognized on cash and cash equivalents under IFRS 9is eliminated from non-cash income and expenses in the statement of cash flows. Cash of € 88,702thousand (prior period: € 190,331thousand) is restricted due to the restrictions on capital transfers, mainly in some Asian countries. Cash flow from operating activities The cash flow from operating activities is derived indirectly from the earnings of the Group. Income tax payments are added to earnings before income taxes which is also adjusted for net interest and non-cash items. The latter includes amortization and depreciation of non-current assets, the profit from entities accounted for using the equity method and the net gain or loss on the disposal of property,­ plant and equipment. To derive the cash flow from operating activities, changes in the items of the statement of financial position that result from operating activities are then considered. Effects from foreign currency translation and changes in the consolidated group are eliminated. Changes in operating assets and ­liabilities contained in the consolidated statement of cash flows therefore do not necessarily match the changes in the related items of the consolidated statement of financial position. The amortization and depreciation reported in the consolidated statement of cash flows in the 2019reporting period were not reduced by the amount contained in net interest or investment income (prior period: € 478thousand). The cash flow from operating activities contains effects of € 22,046thousand from non-recourse ­financing and premature settlement of letters of credit (prior period: € 24,888thousand). 3.81 -OTHER NON-CASH INCOME AND EXPENSES € k 2019 2018 Result from contingent purchase -87 price installments 50 Income from the disposal of assets - 61 and liabilities classified as held for sale Valuation or impairment on financial assets -827 and other investments 427 Currency translation differences and other 1,227 1,218 Total 1,704 365 162 ANNUAL REPORT 2019 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the consolidated financial statements Cash flow from investing activities The cash flow from investing activities is derived from actual cash flows. This relates mainly to the cash outflows for investments made in non-current assets, investments of free cash and acquisitions. Cash outflows for the acquisition of property, plant and equipment are divided into € 21,194thousand (prior period: Under the accounting of leases pursuant to IFRS 16, cash flow from investing activities only shows a cash outflow for prepayments and acquisition-related costs, because the addition of right-of-use assets is not accompanied by cash outflow, except in the abovementioned cases. The same applied to the conclusion of extension of finance lease contracts in the prior period. The payments for leases are reported under cash flow from financing activities. The \"acquisitions, net of cash acquired\" item in the reporting period contains the purchase price for the asset deal in Turkey. The Dürr Group did not receive any cash and cash equivalents from this trans- action. In the prior period, the purchase price for Megtec/­Universal of € 125,340thousand contained cash and cash equi­valents of Cash flow from financing activities The cash flow from financing activities is also derived from actual cash flows. It contains dividends and cash paid to shareholders and non-controlling interests, interest paid for the bond, Schuldschein loans and the other financing activities. It also includes the payments made to settle liabilities under the terms of leases and other non-current loans. The line item \"Change in current bank liabilities and other financing activities\" mainly contains cash inflows and outflows from overdraft facilities. On July 4, 2019, the Dürr Group received cash and cash equivalents of € 199,565thousand (after deducting transaction costs) from the sustainability Schuldschein loan. In the reporting period, there were cash outflows of € 8,750thousand for the acquisition of the remaining 25%of the shares in Benz GmbH Werkzeugsysteme and its subsidiary. In the prior period, the Dürr Group acquired further shares in HOMAGGroup AG. The purchase price for these shares was € 34,802thou- sand. Pursuant to IAS 7\"Statement of Cash Flows\", the cash outflow for the additional shares was contained in the cash flow from financing activities under the item \"Cash paid for transactions with non-controlling interests\", as the entities were already previously fully consolidated in the Dürr Group. Interest paid includes the payment of guaranteed dividends to the outside HOMAGGroup AGshareholders, as the conclusion of the domination and profit and loss transfer agreement has led to the situation where outside shareholders according to IFRSaccounting are not considered as owners of non-controlling interests. Interest payments from lease liabilities in the 2019reporting period amounted to € 3,039thousand. According to the amendments to IAS 7\"Statement of Cash Flows\", the reconciliation in table 3.82presents the changes in liabilities from financing activities. These are defined as liabilities whose cash inflows and outflows are recognized in the statement of cash flows as cash flows from financing activities. This includes liabilities related to the acquisition of non-controlling interests. Assets that serve to hedge non-current liabilities are also presented here.

The basis for segment reporting in accordance with IFRS 8is the same as that used internally. Management monitors the sales revenues and the EBITfrom each of the five divisions separately for the purpose of making decisions about resource allocation and evaluating operating segment performance as well as the development of the segments. Group financing (including finance costs and finance income) and income taxes are managed on a group basis and are not allocated to operating segments. Sales revenues from contracts with customers are accounted for pursuant to IFRS 15for every division and divided into sales reve- nues recognized over time and recognized at a point in time. Only the Woodworking Machinery and Systems division recognizes most sales revenues from contracts with customers when control is transferred, which is related to the high degree of standardization of the machines and the resulting potential alternative uses. All other divisions primarily generate their sales revenues over time due to the conditions of their contracts.

RISK MANAGEMENT AND DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The Group operates in countries in which there are political and economic risks. These risks did not have any material effect on the Group in the 2019reporting period. The Dürr Group may be involved in litigation, including product liability, in the ordinary course of business. There are no matters pending that the Board of Management expects to be material in relation to the Group's business or financial position. Provision has been made for expected litigation costs. The Group is generally exposed to financial risks. These include mainly credit risks, liquidity risks and exposure to interest rate changes or currency risks. The regulations for a Group- wide risk policy are set forth in the Group's guidelines. Detailed information on the risk management system of the Dürr Group can be found in the \"Risk report\" in the combined management report. Credit risk Credit risk relates to the possibility that business partners may fail to meet their obligations in a transaction involving non-derivative and derivative financial instruments and that capital losses could be incurred as a result. For a valuation allowance to be recognized pursuant to IFRS 9, the credit risks of the individual debtors are firstly segmented using common credit risk characteristics. Determining the valuation allowance requires a diversified analysis of the debtors. Information on delayed payment and current market information, such as credit default swaps, future assessments by management and external ratings, among other things, are used for the analysis. This involves dividing the respective debtors into important and less important debtors measured in terms of the volume of the business relationship. As the economic development of the Dürr Group hinges to a large extent on the willingness of the automotive industry to invest, some automotive manufacturers are for example classified as important debtors. Despite their modest number, the Dürr Group generates a significant portion of sales revenues in business with these debtors. Using the simplified approach, this information is processed and used to derive valuation allowance rates. These are applied throughout the Group as provision matrices. With the general approach, the valuation allowance rates for important debtors are calculated on an individual basis. However, for less important debtors, clusters are formed to calculate the valuation allowance rates. The quantification of the expected credit losses primarily relates to three risk parameters: Probability of default, loss given default and exposure at default. Depending on the debtor and maturity, the calculated amount of the valuation allowance rates ranges from virtually 0%to 2.5%. The credit risks and associated valuation allowance rates are regularly reviewed and adjusted accordingly. In order to minimize the credit risk, credit ratings are performed for new customers, while the payment patterns of regular customers are analyzed on an ongoing basis. In addition to this, for certain customer groups with a higher risk of default the Group analyzes market information in the public domain and publications. The Dürr Group uses respective terms of payment as well as credit insurance policies such as letters of credit, trade credit insurance policies and federal government guarantees to further limit the risk of default. The maximum credit risk is shown by the carrying amount of financial assets recognized in the statement of financial position. Further explanations on the valuation and impairment of financial assets can be found in note 7. ANNUAL REPORT 2019 169 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the consolidated financial statements 3.88 -RECEIVABLES SECURED AGAINST DEFAULT € k Dec. 31, 2019 Dec. 31, 2018 Letters of credit 8,241 21,583 Trade credit insurance policies 3,156 1,130 11,397 22,713 In connection with the investment of liquid funds, investments as part of financial asset management and the portfolio of derivative financial assets, the Group is exposed to losses from credit risks should the credit institutions and companies fail to meet their obli- gations. The Dürr Group manages the resulting risk position by diversifying the portfolio and selecting the counterparties care- fully. No cash and cash equivalents, investments of active asset management or derivative financial assets were past due on account of credit defaults. Dependence on few customers Due to the concentration of certain divisions on the automotive industry, a significant portion of the Group's receivables are due from comparably few automobile manufacturers. Generally these receivables are not secured by bank guarantees or other collateral. As of December 31, 2019, 27.9%(prior period: 30.6%) of the trade receivables were due from ten customers. Owing to its customers' group structure with international subsidiaries, the Dürr Group does not see any concentration of credit risk from its business relations with individual debtors or groups of debtors despite the fact that its business is concentrated on a relatively small number of ­customers. Due to the various divisions each with its own different customer base, the level of diversity displayed among the Group's customers is high compared to other automotive suppliers. Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group may not be in a position to meet its obligations in the future, or to meet them at a reasonable price, when they fall due. The liquidity situation is secured by available cash and cash equivalents as well as the credit lines which the Group can draw on. The situation is monitored and managed by means of a liquidity plan with a planning horizon of 18months, coupled with a short-term liquidity forecast. In addition, use of cross-border cash pooling structures has improved the structure of the statement of financial position through liquidity pooling, reduced the volume of borrowed funds and thus helped to enhance the financial result. At the same time, the liquidity situation has become more transparent. More- over, excess liquidity at individual entities within the Group can be used to finance the cash needs of other Group entities internally. Dürr AGconcluded a syndicated loan on July 25, 2019, and on its effective date August 7, 2019, replaced the existing syndicated loan from 2014. The new syndicated loan of the Dürr Group runs until July 25, 2024and can be extended twice by one year each by the Dürr Group. Please refer to note 31for further details. There are also financial guarantees of € 2,674thousand (prior period: € 2,703thousand). They were issued as part of sales financing to customers. The Group does not currently expect this to result in any significant cash outflows. Table 3.89shows the contractually agreed (undiscounted) interest and principal payments for financial liabilities. Foreign currency risk Currency risks exist in particular where receivables or liabilities are carried or will arise in the ordinary course of business in a currency other than the functional currency of the entity. Foreign exchange risks are hedged where they affect the cash flows of the Group. Foreign exchange risks that do not affect the cash flows of the Group (i.e., the risks from translating the items from the statement of financial position of foreign operations to the euro, the Group's reporting currency), however, are generally not hedged. Forward exchange transactions are entered into to hedge exchange rate fluctuations from cash flows relating to forecast purchase and sales transactions with original terms of up to 84months (prior period: 84months). Regarding the presentation of market risks, IFRS 7\"Financial Instruments: Disclosures\" requires sensitivity analyses showing­ how profit or loss and equity would have been affected by hypo­ thetical changes in the relevant risk variables. The periodic expenses are determined by relating the hypothetical changes of the risk variables to the financial instruments as of the end of the reporting period. The presentation is based on the assumption that the portfolio at the end of the reporting period was representative for the whole year. Currency risks as defined by IFRS 7arise from financial instruments that are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency and are of a monetary nature; exchange differences from the translation of financial statements to the Group's currency are not taken into account. All currencies other than the functional currency in which the Dürr Group holds financial instruments are relevant risk variables. 170 ANNUAL REPORT 2019 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the consolidated financial statements 3.89 -INTEREST AND PRINCIPAL PAYMENTS FOR FINANCIAL LIABILITIES Cash flows Carrying amount as of Total € k Dec. 31, 2019 Current non-current Medium-term Long-term Non-derivative financial liabilities Trade payables 479,011 478,771 240 240 - Bond 299,186 8,625 308,625 308,625 - Schuldschein loans 499,056 6,165 526,933 295,015 231,918 Liabilities to banks 366 366 - - - Other financial liabilities 17,358 10,125 7,233 7,233 - Lease liabilities 107,101 30,179 88,543 60,263 28,280 Obligations from options 210,884 207,8341 3,050 3,050 - Liabilities from contingent purchase price installments 552 552 - - - Sundry financial liabilities 111,000 107,824 3,176 3,176 - Derivative financial liabilities Derivatives not used for hedging 1,059 1,039 20 20 - Derivatives used for hedging 2,685 2,641 44 44 - Cash flows Carrying amount as of Total € k Dec. 31, 2018 Current non-current Medium-term Long-term Non-derivative financial liabilities Trade payables 502,370 501,403 967 927 40 Bond 298,597 8,625 317,250 317,250 - Schuldschein loan 299,361 4,478 321,744 215,744 106,000 Liabilities to banks 1,002 1,002 - - - Sundry financial liabilities 17,139 9,587 7,552 7,552 - Finance lease liabilities 7,182 2,120 5,534 4,783 751 Obligations from options 214,767 213,5431 1,224 1,224 - Liabilities from contingent purchase price installments 9,532 9,532 - - - Sundry financial liabilities 122,092 117,391 4,701 4,671 30 Derivative financial liabilities Derivatives not used for hedging 1,124 1,112 12 12 - Derivatives used for hedging 6,449 6,120 329 329 - 1 The cash flows for obligations from options relate primarily to the sundry financial liability recognized under the domination and profit and loss transfer agreement with HOMAG Group AG.

ANNUAL REPORT 2019 171 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the consolidated financial statements Material non-derivative monetary items which constitute currency risks for the Group are cash, trade receivables and payables as well as contract assets. Non-derivative financial instruments which could give rise to currency risks are usually hedged by derivative financial instruments that are accounted for as fair value hedges. In the process, both the change in the non-derivative financial instrument and the change in the value of the derivative financial instrument are recognized through profit or loss. In addition, Dürr is exposed to currency risks from derivatives that are embedded, in accordance with IAS 39, in effective cash flow hedges of fluctuation in payments caused by exchange rates. Exchange rate changes concerning the currencies underlying these transactions affect the currency reserve in equity and the fair value of the hedges. The analyses of the Group's sensitivity to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates use the currency pairs that are relevant for the Dürr Group. This involves projecting the impact of a hypothetical 10%appreciation, or depreciation respectively, of the euro against the USdollar, the Chinese renminbi, pound sterling, the Polish zloty as well as an appreciation and depreciation of the USdollar against the Mexican peso and the Korean won. Interest rate risk Interest rate risks arise from fluctuations in interest rates that could have a negative impact on the net assets, financial position and results of operations of the Group. Interest rate fluctuations lead to changes in net interest and in the carrying amounts of the interest-bearing assets and liabilities. The Dürr Group concluded interest rate swaps with a nominal value of € 100million to hedge against the interest rate risk from the variable tranches of the Schuldschein loan concluded in 2016. The changes in cash flows from the hedged transactions resulting from changes in the Euribor rate are offset by changes in cash flows from the interest rate swaps. The aim of the hedging measures is to transform the variable-rate financial liabilities into fixed-interest financial liabilities and thus to hedge the risks in the cash flow from the financial liabilities. Credit risks are not hedged. A hypothetical increase in the interest rates of 25base points per year would have not have caused any increase in the fair value of the interest rate swaps and equity. A hypothetical decrease in the interest rates of 25base points per year would also not have caused any decrease in the fair value of the interest rate swaps and equity.

The Dürr Group has cash and cash equivalents that are subject to fluctuation in interest rates as of December 31, 2019. A hypothetical increase in these interest rates of 25base points per year would have caused a € 1,265thousand (prior period: € 1,278thousand) increase in interest income. A hypothetical decrease of 25base points per year would have caused a € 1,265thousand (prior period: Other price risks In the presentation of market risks, IFRS 7also requires disclosures on the effects of hypothetical changes in the risk variables on the price of financial instruments. The main risk variables include stock market prices and indices. Please refer to note 35for more information on the price risk of the financial assets, equity instruments, options and the liabilities from contingent purchase price installments disclosed as a level 3financial instrument. Use of derivative financial instruments Derivative financial instruments are used in the Group to minimize the risks concerning changes in exchange rates and interest rates on cash flows and the change in fair value of receivables and liabilities. Hedging allows the amount of the expected cash inflow/ outflow in the functional currency to be estimated in advance. This generally involves fully hedging all payments for which there is significant economic risk from changes in the exchange and interest rate. The Dürr Group is exposed to a replacement risk in the event of non-performance by counterparties (credit institutions) ­relating to the financial instruments. Derivative financial instruments, mainly forward contracts, are only entered into to hedge the operating business and to hedge loans. In hedging the operating business, derivative financial instruments are entered into on the basis of an internal estimate of progress and payment dates. In order to ensure the effectiveness of the hedging relationships, various features/param- eters, such as expected date and volume of payment between the hedged item and corresponding hedge are reviewed and adjusted if necessary. Any ineffectiveness may result, for example, from various different credit risks and delays in contract processing. How- ever, any hedges entered into are expected to be highly effective in offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows. They are assessed on an ongoing basis to determine that they actually have been highly effective throughout the periods for which they were designated. All financial derivatives as well as the respective hedged transactions are subject to regular internal control and measurement in accordance with the directive of the Board of Management. The hedged transactions are primarily included in the following items of the statement of financial position: Trade receivables and trade pay- ables, contract assets, dividend payments and the interest hedge for the Schuldschein loan from 2016. The hedging relationships from cash flow and fair value hedges did not result in any significant inef- fectiveness. The changes in value of the hedged transactions therefore run counter to the developments of derivatives. At the inception of the hedge, the hedging relationship and the entity's risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge are formally documented. This documentation contains identification of the hedging instrument, the related hedged item or transaction, the nature of the risk being hedged, and how the entity 3.91 -SCOPE AND FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Change in the fair value to Nominal value Positive market value Negative market value recognize ineffectiveness € k Dec. 31, 2019 Dec. 31, 2018 Dec. 31, 2019 Interest rate swaps in connection with cash flow hedges 100,000 100,000 - Forward exchange contracts 480,921 488,146 3,807 thereof in connection with cash flow hedges 139,741 135,818 2,820 thereof in connection with fair value hedges 39,508 67,526 357 thereof not used for hedging 301,672 284,802 630 Dec. 31, 2018 Dec. 31, 2019 - -108 3,691 -3,636 2,163 -2,033 905 -544 623 -1,059 Dec. 31, 2018 Dec. 31, 2019 Dec. 31, 2018 -323 -108 -323 -7,250 600 -3,058 -4,452 787 -2,289 -1,674 -187 -769 -1,124 - - ANNUAL REPORT 2019 173 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the consolidated financial statements 3.92 -NOMINAL VALUES OF HEDGING INSTRUMENTS Total € k Total Current non-current Medium-term Long-term Interest rate swaps in connection with cash flow hedges 100,000 100,000 - - - (2018) (100,000) (-) (100,000) (100,000) (-) Forward exchange contracts 480,921 460,519 20,402 20,402 - (2018) (488,146) (455,782) (32,364) (32,364) (-) thereof in connection with cash flow hedges 139,741 132,582 7,159 7,159 - (2018) (135,818) (127,088) (8,730) (8,730) (-) thereof in connection with fair value hedges 39,508 39,508 - - - (2018) (67,526) (67,526) (-) (-) (-) thereof not used for hedging 301,672 288,429 13,243 13,243 - (2018) (284,802) (261,168) (23,634) (23,634) (-) will assess the hedging instrument's effectiveness in offsetting the exposure to changes in the hedged item's fair value or the hedged item's cash flows attributable to the hedged risk. Depending on their market value at the end of the reporting period, derivative financial instruments are reported under sundry financial assets (positive market value) or sundry financial liabilities (negative market value) respectively. The fair value of the financial instruments was estimated using the following methods and assumptions. The fair values of the forward exchange contracts were estimated at the present value of cash flows on the basis of the difference between the contractually agreed forward exchange rates and the forward rate prevailing at the end of the reporting period. The fair values of the interest hedges are estimated as the discounted value of expected future cash flows based on current market parameters. 3.93 -AVERAGE RATES AND INTEREST FOR DERIVATIVE­­ FINANCIAL­INSTRUMENTS CONCLUDED FOR SIGNIFICANT­CURRENCY PAIRS AND INTEREST HEDGES Average rate Closing rate € k Dec. 31, 2019 Dec. 31, 2018 Dec. 31, 2019 Dec. 31, 2018 Interest hedge 1.2675 % 1.2675 % - - EUR/CNY 7.9819 8.1032 7.8328 7.8600 EUR/GBP 0.8675 0.8952 0.8501 0.8971 EUR/PLN 4.3157 4.3326 4.2597 4.2981 EUR/USD 1.1348 1.1876 1.1228 1.1453 USD/KRW 1,166.7827 1,081.7207 1,154.6046 1,114.9368 USD/MXN 19.7195 20.4610 18.9163 19.6626 Accounting and disclosure of derivative financial ­instruments and hedge accounting Currency hedges that clearly serve to hedge future cash flows from foreign exchange transactions and which meet the requirements of IAS 39in terms of documentation and effectiveness are accounted for as cash flow hedges.

Auditor's fees also include fees for voluntary audits of separate financial statements of € 144thousand (prior period: € 88thousand). The fees for non-audit services comprise voluntary audit of financial­ statements, audit-related services, tax services and other services. They amounted to € 495thousand in the 2019reporting period (prior period: € 393thousand). Subsequent events The corona epidemic initially impacted economic activities above all in China. Since the beginning of March, however, the crisis has also been increasingly spreading to Europe and America. As things currently stand, it seems possible for the Dürr Group to make up for a large part of the corona-related declines incurred so far in the further course of the year. For fiscal year 2020, no material impacts on the assets, financial position and results of operations of the Group are expected at this time. However, the economic risks resulting from the corona crisis have increased significantly in recent weeks. Chief Financial Officer Carlo Crosetto left the Company of his own volition at the end of his service agreement on February 29, 2020. With the approval of the Supervisory Board, in February 2020the Board of Management decided that the variable tranches (€ 100,000thousand) of the Schuldschein loan issued in 2016be replaced prematurely in April 2020and refinanced to further optimize corporate financing in terms of interest expenses and maturities. Between the beginning of the current reporting period and March 18, 2020, there have been no events that could have a material influence on the net assets, financial position and results of operations of the Group.

In addition, we have audited the group management report of Dürr Aktiengesellschaft for the reporting period from January 1to December 31, 2019, which is combined with the management report (\"group management report\"). In accordance with the German legal requirements, we have not audited the content of the group non-financial statement included in the \"Sustainability\" section of the group management report as well as the disclosures in the \"Other information on corporate governance\" section and the Corporate Governance Declaration. In our opinion, on the basis of the knowledge obtained in the audit, Pursuant to Sec. 322(3) Sentence 1 HGB, we declare that our audit has not led to any reservations relating to the legal compliance of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report. 188 ANNUAL REPORT 2019 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Independent auditor's report BASIS FOR THE OPINIONS We conducted our audit of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report in accordance with Sec. 317 HGBand the EUAudit Regulation (No 537/2014, referred to subsequently as \"EUAudit Regulation\") and in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Audits promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer [Insti- tute of Public Auditors in Germany] (IDW). Our responsibilities under those requirements and principles are further described in the \"Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial statements and the Group management report\" section of our auditor's­ report. We are independent of the group entities in accordance with the requirements of European law and German commercial and professional law, and we have fulfilled our other German professional responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. In addition, in accordance with Art. 10(2) f) of the EUAudit Regulation, we declare that we have not provided non-­audit services prohibited under Art. 5(1) of the EUAudit Regulation. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the group management report. KEY AUDIT MATTERS IN THE AUDIT OF THE ­CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judg- ment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements for the reporting period from January 1to December 31, 2019. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon; we do not provide a separate ­opinion on these matters. Below, we describe what we consider to be the key audit matters: 1. Impairment testing of goodwill Reasons why the matter was determined to be a key audit matter: Goodwill is subject to an annual impairment test. As a rule, the basis of the measurements is the present value of future cash flows of the cash-generating unit to be measured to which goodwill was allocated. The measurements are based on budgetary planning of the cash-generating units for four detailed planning years. The discounting is based on the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) of the respective cash-generating unit. The inputs used in the calculation of the discounting rate are partly based on estimated market expectations and are, therefore, also subject to judgment. The result of these measurements depends chiefly on the future cash inflows of each company estimated by the executive directors­ as well as the discount rate used and is, therefore, subject to uncertainty. Auditor's response: The subsidiaries' budgets are consolidated by division and reviewed and approved by the Board of Management in a multi-stage process. The Supervisory Board approves the budget for the following year and acknowledges the long-term planning for the next three years. Due to new developments, the budget was updated once again. For our audit we relied on these internal controls and reviewed their effectiveness. Our assessment was based, among other things, on a comparison with general and industry-specific market expectations as well as management explanations regarding the significant value drivers in the budgets and forecasts. We also compared the plans for consistency with the forecast information provided in the group management report. We also analyzed the budget-to-actual comparison of the prior-period planning on the basis of a target-actual deviation analysis. We assessed the underlying valuation models for the determination of net realizable value in terms of methodology and re-performed the calculations with the assistance of internal valuation specialists. We assessed the derivation of the risk-­ adjusted discount rate with the involvement of our internal experts in particular by scrutinizing the peer group, comparing market data with external evidence and checking the clerical accuracy. We also checked the results of the impairment test for plausibility using our own sensitivity analyses. Our audit procedures did not lead to any reservations relating to the assessment of goodwill impairment. Reference to related disclosures: The Company's disclosures on the impairment of goodwill in terms of the recognition and measurement policies applied in accounting as well as the associated judgments are contained in notes 7and 18of the notes to the consolidated financial statements. ANNUAL REPORT 2019 189 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Independent auditor's report 2. Revenue recognition over time and accounting for construction contracts pursuant to IFRS 15 (Revenue from Contracts with Customers) Reasons why the matter was determined to be a key audit matter: Sales revenues from customer-specific construction contracts are generally calculated according to the progress towards complete satisfaction of a performance obligation pursuant to IFRS 15. This involves recognizing sales revenues and the planned contract margin in line with the degree to which the contract has been com- pleted. The degree of completion is calculated on the basis of the costs incurred relative to the total estimated costs. The application of revenue recognition over time pursuant to IFRS 15requires substantial exercise of judgment, particularly related to the estimate of the total costs of a contract and the consideration of contract modifications and project risks. Auditor's response: In assessing the contract analysis performed by the executive direc- tors, we evaluated in particular whether the requirements to recognize revenue over time have been met based on construction con- tracts. We relied on a controls-based approach during the audit and examined the underlying corporate processes and tested controls relevant for the processing and accounting of construction con- tracts, particularly for the calculation of contract values, the processes for the estimate of contract costs as well as the reporting and allocation of accrued costs. We also tested the control mechanisms in the area of contract acceptance and planning as well as in the area of budgeting and cost control for their proper functioning. To identify anomalies in the development of margins over the course of the year and to recognize them compared to the prior period, we performed analyses of the planned costs and changes in contract ­values. With regard to the status of completion and the assessment of the risks associated with the contract, we obtained management's evaluation of the significant contracts. Furthermore, we performed the following substantive procedures for specific construction contracts: ȖȖVerified whether the material and production costs recognized for each construction contract were allocated properly and in the correct period, during which we primarily verified the allocation of costs in terms of their amount and the related project using orders, evidence of services as well as supplier invoices; Our audit procedures did not lead to any reservations regarding the revenue recognition over time and accounting of construction ­contracts according to IFRS 15. Reference to related disclosures: The Company's disclosures on the recognition and measurement policies applied in accounting with regard to the revenue recognition over time and accounting of construction contracts according to IFRS 15are contained in notes 7, 8, 21and 22of the notes to the consolidated financial statements. 3. Recognition and measurement of income tax ­provisions and deferred taxes Reasons why the matter was determined to be a key audit matter: The Dürr Group operates in different legal systems coupled with the complexity of changing tax law as well transfer pricing issues. The calculation of provisions for income tax obligations as well as the 190 ANNUAL REPORT 2019 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Independent auditor's report accounting assessment and measurement of deferred and uncertain tax items requires that the executive directors of Dürr Aktien­ gesellschaft exercise judgment for the assessment of subject matters related to tax and must perform estimates regarding income tax risks. In the context of accounting and measurement of deferred tax items, an assessment of future usability of the tax loss carryforwards­ as well as other deferred tax assets from temporary differences is necessary. The recognition of deferred tax assets for tax loss carry- forwards depends on the usability of losses in each country due to country-specific provisions on the one hand, and, on the other, on budget assumptions for future taxable income. Particularly the corporate planning regarding the future taxable income is subject to judgment to a high degree. The executive directors make estimates regarding the economic development of every taxable entity, which is affected by the current and future market environment. Auditor's response: Due to the complexity in the area of tax provisions, we consulted internal experts from our tax department with expertise in the relevant local legal systems and provisions in our audit. We also assessed the correspondence with the responsible tax authorities,­ analyzed and reviewed the assumptions for the calculation of income tax provisions on the basis of their knowledge and experience in the current application of the relevant legal provisions by the authorities and courts. To assess the recognition and measurement of deferred taxes at Group companies, we considered, among other things, the under­lying processes for complete reporting and measurement of deferred taxes as well as to avoid or detect and correct errors. In addition, we verified the identification and quantification of deviations between the recognition and measurement of assets and ­liabilities according to income tax provisions and financial reporting in accordance with IFRSs as well as the calculation of the deferred taxes with regard to these deviations using the corresponding tax rate. For the impairment testing of deferred tax assets from temporary differences as well as from loss carryforwards, we verified using samples whether tax forecasts were derived from corporate planning, the Group-wide planning horizon was used to assess the usability of tax loss carryforwards and the respective country-specific tax requirements for the use of loss carryforwards were observed. In the course of our substantive audit procedures for uncertain tax treatments, we assessed the compliance with the relevant local tax law of assessments made by the executive directors for tax implications of significant business transactions or events in the 2019reporting period, from which uncertain tax treatments may result or could influence the measurement of existing uncertain tax treat- ments. In particular, this includes the income tax implications arising­ from the acquisition or disposal of company shares, corporate restructuring as well as findings from tax field audits. Our audit procedures did not lead to any reservations regarding the recognition and measurement of income tax provisions and deferred taxes. Reference to related disclosures: The Company's disclosures on the accounting policies for income tax provisions and deferred taxes are contained in notes 7and 17of the notes to the consolidated financial statements. 4. Restructuring measures Reasons why the matter was determined to be a key audit matter: In connection with the changes in market conditions in the Woodworking Machinery and Systems division, process improvements and structural adjustments were announced in the fiscal year 2019and the works council was informed. The measures adopted include the closure of the Hemmoor production site and further personnel adjustments at other locations. During our audit, we determined this as a key audit matter because the valuation of the obligations is significantly influenced by the estimates and assumptions of the executive directors and may result in significant effects on various items of the consolidated financial statements (non-current liabilities, provisions, cost of sales, selling, general and administrative expenses). Auditor's response: During our audit of the restructuring measures, we examined the underlying corporate processes and performed analytical audit procedures and substantive testing. The audit procedures regarding the reported expenses as well as the recognition and measurement of provisions and ­liabilities included in particular the review of restructuring plans, the ANNUAL REPORT 2019 191 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Independent auditor's report associated­ ­written agreements and contracts and communication with employees. For the group companies and the potential employees affected by these measures, we compared the years in service and salary information for payroll accounting with the personnel master data, and tested the underlying assumptions on the basis of past experience, for example, comparable previous restructuring measures. Our audit procedures did not lead to any exceptions relating to the accounting treatment of restructuring measures. Reference to related disclosures: The Company's disclosures related to the restructuring measures are contained in notes 7and 28of the notes to the consolidated financial statements. OTHER INFORMATION The Supervisory Board is responsible for the Report of the Supervisory Board. Otherwise, the executive directors are responsible for other information. Other information particularly comprises the following components of the annual report: The Chairman's ­letter, the Report of the Supervisory Board, the section \"Dürr on the capital market\", the disclosures made in the annual report in the Responsibility Statement contained in the consolidated ­financial statements, the group non-financial statement included in the \"Sus- tainability\" section of the group management report as well as the disclosures in the \"Other information on corporate governance\" section and the Corporate Governance Declaration. We received a version of this \"Other information\" by the time this auditor's report was issued. Our opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the group management report do not cover the other information, and consequently we do not express an opinion or any other form of assurance conclusion thereon. In connection with our audit, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in so doing, to consider whether the other information RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE EXECUTIVE ­DIRECTORS AND THE SUPERVISORY BOARD FOR THE ­CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT The executive directors are responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements that comply, in all ­material respects, with IFRSs as adopted by the EUand the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to Sec. 315e (1) HGB, and that the consolidated financial statements, in compliance with these requirements, give a true and fair view of the assets, ­liabilities, financial position, and financial performance of the Group. In addition, the executive directors are responsible for such internal control as they have determined necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the executive directors are responsible for assessing the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. They also have the responsibility for dis- closing, as applicable, matters related to going concern. In addition,­ they are responsible for financial reporting based on the going ­concern basis of accounting unless there is an intention to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or there is no realistic alter­ native but to do so. Furthermore, the executive directors are responsible for the preparation of the group management report that, as a whole, provides an appropriate view of the Group's position and is, in all material respects, consistent with the consolidated financial statements, complies with German legal requirements, and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development. In addition, the executive directors are responsible for such arrangements and measures (systems) as they have considered necessary to enable the preparation of a group management report that is in accordance 192 ANNUAL REPORT 2019 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Independent auditor's report with the applicable German legal requirements, and to be able to provide sufficient appropriate evidence for the assertions in the group management report. The Supervisory Board is responsible for overseeing the Group's financial reporting process for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report. AUDITOR'S RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE AUDIT OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND OF THE GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and whether the group management report as a whole provides an appropriate view of the Group's position and, in all material respects, is consistent with the consolidated financial statements and the knowledge obtained in the audit, complies with the German legal requirements and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development, as well as to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the group management report. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with Sec. 317 HGBand the EUAudit Regulation and in compliance with German Generally­ Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Audits promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer (IDW) will always detect a material misstatement. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggre- gate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements and this group management report. We exercise professional judgment and maintain professional ­skepticism throughout the audit. We also: from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepre- sentations, or the override of internal control; ANNUAL REPORT 2019 193 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Independent auditor's report events will differ materially from the prospective information. We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit. We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with the relevant independence require- ments, and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence and where applicable, the related safeguards. From the matters communicated with those charged with gover- nance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter. OTHER LEGAL AND REGUL ATORY REQUIREMENTS Further information pursuant to Art. 10 of the EU Audit Regulation We were elected as auditor of the consolidated financial statements by the annual general meeting on May 10, 2019. We were engaged by the Supervisory Board on November 6, 2019. We have been the group auditor of Dürr Aktiengesellschaft without interruption since the 2002reporting period. We declare that the opinions expressed in this auditor's report are consistent with the additional report to the audit committee ­pursuant to Art. 11of the EUAudit Regulation (long-form audit report).

The following text is a trans­ lation of the original German Independent Assurance Report. To Dürr Aktiengesellschaft, Stuttgart We have performed a limited assurance engagement on the group non-financial statement of Dürr Aktiengesellschaft according to MANAGEMENT'S RESPONSIBILIT Y The legal representatives of the Company are responsible for the preparation of the group non-financial statement in accordance with §§ 315c in conjunction with 289c to 289e HGB. This responsibility includes the selection and application of appropriate methods to prepare the group non-financial statement as well as making assumptions and estimates related to individual dis- closures, which are reasonable in the circumstances. Furthermore, the legal representatives are responsible for such internal controls that they have considered necessary to enable the preparation of a group non-financial statement that is free from material misstate- ment, whether due to fraud or error. AUDITOR'S DECL AR ATION REL ATING TO INDEPENDENCE AND QUALIT Y CONTROL We are independent from the Company in accordance with the provisions under German commercial law and professional require- ments, and we have fulfilled our other professional responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.

In a limited assurance engagement the assurance procedures are less in extent than for a reasonable assurance engagement and therefore a substantially lower level of assurance is obtained. The assurance procedures selected depend on the auditor's professional judgment. Within the scope of our assurance engagement, which has been conducted between December 2019and March 2020, we performed amongst others the following assurance and other procedures: ASSUR ANCE CONCLUSION Based on our assurance procedures performed and ­assurance ­evidence obtained, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the group non-financial statement of Dürr Aktien­ gesellschaft for the period from 1January 2019to 31December 2019has not been prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with §§ 315c in conjunction with 289c to 289e HGB.

processes­ adapt autonomously to new tasks and are self-opti- mizing. This relies on the machines being digitally connected and their data evaluated. Application technology General term for all products related to the ­application of paint and high-viscosity materials, e. g. painting robots, paint atomizers, and color change systems. B Balancing technology Rotating components such as wheels and turbines must be tested for imbalances. Any imbalance is then removed since it would otherwise cause ­vibrations or oscillations. D Digital service Digital services use operating data to optimize production operations and increase system availability. One example of this is predictive maintenance. In this, an app provides early notification when maintenance work is due for a system or when a component has to be replaced. Dip-coating Process for applying the first prime coat that protects­ against corrosion. To coat the interior of the body as well, it is immersed. The coating is applied with the aid of an electric field. Drying oven Tunnel-like systems for curing freshly applied coats of paint. E End of line Area in final vehicle assembly where the assembled cars are tested and prepared for shipping. Engineering Development and design of machinery and plants. At Dürr, engineering often involves developing ­technical solutions that are geared to customers' specific production goals. F Filling systems Equipment designed for filling vehicles with the neces- sary operating media (e. g. brake fluid, refrigerant)­in the course of their final assembly. Filling systems are also employed for charging refrigerators, air conditioners and heat pumps with refrigerant. G Glueing technology Manufacturing process, in which parts such as the sheet-metal components of a car are joined together by means of adhesives. H High-speed rotating atomizer Atomizers ensure a uniform distribution of the spray jet in paint application processes. High rotation atomizers rely on a bell-shaped disk revolving at up to 70,000 r.p.m. Due to this design, the paint fed to the center of the disk is accelerated and separated into fine threads which dissolve into minuscule droplets as they are propelled off the disk. I IIoT / Industrial Internet of Things The term Industrial Internet of Things refers to the use of the Internet of Things in industrial production. The Internet of Things is the digital connection of, and communication between, smart machines and appliances via the internet. IIoT platform Higher-level software system that collects and evaluates big data, i.e. large volumes of production data. To that end, the machines from one or more production systems are fitted with sensors. The sensors capture the operating data (e.g. material consumption, cycle time) and transmit it to the IIoT platform. Data evaluation on the IIoT platform ­enables plant operators to gain a better understanding of their production processes and identify potential for optimization. Industry 4.0 Industry 4.0 refers to the digitalization and networking of industrial production. It is aimed at creating a 'Smart Factory' in which production and logistics systems largely organize themselves. L Light vehicles Cars and light trucks. Lightweight design Lightweight design refers to the practice of building cars with weight minimization in mind. The vehic- le's fuel consumption and CO2emissions can thus be reduced. Low-weight materials such as magnesium, titanium or synthetic fiber composites are becoming increasingly widespread to reduce vehicle weight. O Overspray Excess paint that does not land on the surface being sprayed. S Sealing Process for sealing welding seams created when car body parts are joined. Sealing also includes the application of an undercoating that protects against rock impact. T Test systems End of line systems test the functions of fully assembled­ vehicles, e. g. headlights and ABS. Thermal oxidation Thermal oxidation is a process for exhaust-air purifi- cation. The polluted waste air is burned in a combustion chamber. 200 ANNUAL REPORT 2019 OTHER Glossary Financial A Asset coverage A ratio that indicates the extent to which shareholders' equity covers non-current assets. Asset intensity non-current assets 100 (%) total assets C Capital employed This is the capital used within the enterprise that is not subject to interest payable to external creditors. It is calculated by deducting liabilities from total non-current and current assets. However, all interest-bearing items are excluded. D Days sales outstanding G Gearing This is the ratio of net financial debt to shareholders'­ equity and net financial debt. The higher the relative weight of net financial debt, the higher the reliance on external lenders. However, a high gearing is not necessarily negative if the interest­ paid does not reduce profits excessively. I Interest coverage An interest coverage ratio of <1 indicates that the company is not able to meet its interest payments from operating earnings. earnings before tax + net interest expense net interest expense L Liquidity ratios: cash ratio and quick ratio These two liquidity ratios show the degree to which current liabilities are covered by cash and cash equivalents (and other current assets). They serve to measure a company's solvency. cash and cash equivalents R Return on Capital Employed (ROCE) This measures the rate of return on the capital tied up in a company's operating assets (for instance in machinery and equipment, inventories, accounts receivable) and is the ratio of earnings before ­interest and taxes (EBIT) to capital employed. EBIT 100 (%) capital employed Return on Equity (ROE) This is the rate of return earned on shareholders' equity. It should exceed the rate of return on a comparable investment. earnings after taxes 100 (%) shareholders' equity Return on Investment (ROI) This ratio serves to measure how efficiently a company employs the total resources at its ­disposal. earnings after taxes + interest expense 100 (%) total assets This ratio indicates the average length of time in days that capital is tied up in receivables. current liabilities 100 (%) receivables 360 sales revenues cash and cash equivalents + short-term trade receivables The same method can be used to calculate the average­ length of time that capital is tied up in inventories and in net working capital. E current liabilities N Net financial status 100 (%) Equity assets ratio A ratio that indicates the extent to which shareholders' equity and non-current liabilities cover non-­current assets. equity + non-current liabilities This represents the balance of the financial liabilities reported in the balance sheet after deducting liquid funds. If a company's liquid funds exceed its financial liabilities, it is de facto debt free. financial liabilities liquid funds non-current assets F Free cash flow 100 (%) Net Working Capital (NWC) This is a measure of the net funding required to finance current assets. Negative NWC is beneficial since it implies that sales are prefinanced by suppliers and customers.

      "Press Release Contact: Olivia Riant e-mail: o.riant@lectra.com Office: +33 (0)1 53 64 42 44 2019 earnings in line with revised estimates In millions of euros October 1 - December 31 January 1 - December 31 2019 2018 2019 2018 Revenues 74.2 75 280 282.6 Change like-for-like (%)(1) -2% -3% Income from operations(3) 11.2 12 40.9 40.2 Change like-for-like (%)(1) -10% -6% Operating margin (in % of revenues) 15% 16% 14.6% 14.2% Net income 8 8.6 29.3 28.7 Change at actual exchange rates (%) -7% +2% Free cash flow(3) 18.1 12.8 36.2 21.6 Shareholders' equity(2) 183 170.4 Net cash(2)(3) 120.6 102.2 Paris, February 11, 2020. Today, Lectra's Board of Directors, chaired by Daniel Harari, reviewed the consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year 2019. Audit procedures have been performed by the Statutory Auditors. The certification report will be issued at the end of the Board of Director's meeting of February 25, 2020. (Comparisons between 2019 and 2018 are like-for-like, unless stated otherwise. As the impact of the acquisition of Retviews on the financial statements for the full year is not material, like-for-like changes exclude only the variations in exchange rates). Q4 2019 In a continuing degraded environment that is unlikely to contribute to an upturn in investment decisions by Lectra customers, orders for new systems (30 million euros), decreased by 9% from Q4 2018 (-8% at actual exchange rates). Orders for new systems had amounted to 27.4 million euros in Q1 of this year, 26.5 million euros in Q2, and 28 million euros in Q3. Revenues (74.2 million euros) decreased by 2% (-1% at actual exchange rates). Income from operations (11.2 million euros) was down 10% (-7% at actual exchange rates) and the operating margin (15%) decreased by 1.3 percentage points. Net income (8 million euros) was down 0.6 million euros (-7%) at actual exchange rates. 1 Free cash flow amounted to 18.1 million euros (12.8 million euros in Q4 2018). 2019 Acquisition of the company Retviews On July 15, 2019, Lectra entered into an agreement to acquire the Belgian company Retviews. Founded in 2017, Retviews has developed an innovative technological offer that enables fashion brands to analyze real-time market data and make the best decisions to optimize their collections, increase their sales and margins, thanks to artificial intelligence algorithms. Positive impact of currency changes With an average exchange rate of $1.12/€1, the US dollar was up 6% compared to the same period in 2018, while the yuan strengthened by 1% against the euro. Currency changes thus mechanically increased revenues by 5 million euros (+2%) and income from operations by 3 million euros (+8%) at actual exchange rates compared to like-for-like figures. Challenging macroeconomic and geopolitical environment In a context of uncertainty and apprehension, the entire year was marked by a very strong \"wait-and-see\" attitude by many companies, particularly in the fashion and automotive markets. This adverse climate is primarily the consequence of the trade wars between the United States, on the one hand, and Mexico, China and Europe, on the other, as well as the slowdown in the automotive sector, particularly in China. Earnings in line with revised objectives Orders for new systems (111.9 million euros) were down 10% relative to 2018. Revenues amounted to 280 million euros, down 3% (-1% at actual exchange rates). Revenues from software licenses, equipment and non-recurring services (110.2 million euros) decreased by 12% and recurring revenues (169.8 million euros) increased by 4%. Income from operations totaled 40.9 million euros and the operating margin 14.6%, down 2.4 million euros (-6%) and 0.4 percentage point, respectively. At actual exchange rates, income from operations rose by 2% and the operating margin by 0.4 percentage point. These results are in line with the Group's expectations as set out on July 29. Net income totaled 29.3 million euros, up 0.6 million euros (+2%) at actual exchange rates and free cash flow totaled 36.2 million euros (+14.6 million euros). Greater impact of the sale of software on a subscription basis As expected, both the volume and the percentage of sales of software sold on a subscription basis (SaaS) increased in 2019. This change to the SaaS model will contribute to the long-term development of the Company's activities and strengthen its recurring revenues. In the short-term, however, it has a negative impact on revenues and income from operations, as revenues from software subscriptions are recorded progressively over several years. If the SaaS sales in 2019 had been made in the form of perpetual licenses with their associated maintenance contracts, revenues and income from operations would have been higher by 2.8 million euros and 2.9 million euros, respectively. Therefore, at actual exchange rates, revenues would have been stable, income from operations would have increased by 9%, and the operating margin would have totaled 15.5%. 2 A business model that once again proves its strength With income from operations only slightly lower, and a record 14.6% operating margin despite the decline in new system orders and the impact of the growing percentage of software sold on a subscription basis, the 2019 results demonstrate the strength of Lectra's business model, which is attributable primarily to recurrent revenues and the gross profit margin it generates. The remarkable free cash flow performance (36.2 million euros) also confirms the business model's ability to generate significant free cash flow, which generally exceeds net income, due to the structurally negative working capital requirement. A particularly robust balance sheet At December 31, 2019, consolidated shareholders' equity amounted to 183 million euros and the cash and cash equivalents, as well as net cash position, totaled 120.6 million euros, after the dividend payment of 12.8 million euros declared in respect of fiscal year 2018 and the disbursement of 8 million euros for the acquisition of Retviews. Assessment of the 2017-2019 strategic roadmap Continuing its focus on the long-term, in February 2017 the Group launched its new Lectra 4.0 strategy with the objective to make Lectra an indispensable player in Industry 4.0. This new strategy was embodied in the roadmap for 2017-2019, the first decisive stage in Lectra's evolution over the next ten years, which will further reinforce Lectra's global leadership, ensure sustainable growth, and preserve its profitability. The strategic objectives that Lectra established have been accomplished overall. The detailed assessment of this strategic roadmap appears in the Annual Financial Report of December 31, 2019, released February 11, 2020 to which the reader is referred. Dividend maintained at €0.40 per share The Board of Directors will propose to the Combined Shareholders' Meeting of April 30, 2020 to maintain the dividend at €0.40 per share in respect of FY 2019. This dividend would represent a payout ratio of 44% of consolidated net income and a yield of 1.8% based on the December 31, 2019 closing share price. A new strategic roadmap for 2020-2022 A long-term vision Throughout the world, Lectra customers in the fashion, automotive and furniture markets are faced with both changes in their environment and in consumer behavior, as buyers reveal new expectations in terms of experience and personalization, and demand ever greater transparency, authenticity and ethical commitment from all actors in the value chain. In addition, Industry 4.0 calls for a new approach to organizing production plants based on communication across a configuration of increasingly flexible players and production tools, while optimizing the use of available resources. Launched in 2017, the Lectra 4.0 strategy, which aims to position the Group as a key Industry 4.0 player in its market sectors between now and 2030, is built on four pillars: 3 Acceleration towards Industry 4.0 Lectra will continue to implement its strategy over the next three years. As anticipated back in 2017, the objective of the Group is to capture the full potential of its new offers for Industry 4.0, while delivering sustainable, profitable business growth. To achieve this objective, the Group has set four strategic priorities. First, accelerate organic growth. Lectra will reinforce simultaneously its prospecting actions in order to increase its market shares, and its sales actions aimed at introducing new product lines to existing customers in order to generate higher revenues per customer. The Group will also strive to seize every opportunity in its markets, in particular the transformation of the Chinese ecosystem, the automation of leather cutting in the automotive and furniture sectors and the rise in airbag production. Second, strengthen customer relations. The Group will review its activities with a focus on how its solutions are actually used, in order to anticipate customers' expectations and personalize their interactions with Lectra. In particular, the Group will progressively deploy Customer Success teams country by country in order to optimize customers' performance. Third, extend the offers for Industry 4.0. These offers, whether in new product lines or as additions to existing software and equipment, present strong growth potential for Lectra. Fourth, develop new areas for growth. Continuing on from the previous roadmap, the Group plans to intensify its targeted acquisitions and will promote open innovation, particularly by increasing partnerships. Sustainable, profitable growth To ensure sustainable growth in an uncertain macroeconomic and geopolitical environment, the Group's ambition is to increase recurring revenues by 20% in three years. Recurring revenues should then account for over 60% of the Group's total revenues in 2022, with the following objectives: The Group will use the growth in margin generated by recurring revenues to finance its development, particularly through strong investment in R&D, and reinforcement of its sales and services teams. The security ratio will therefore be maintained at 90% - the 2019 level - during the 2020-2022 period, with continuing strict controls over the increase in fixed overhead costs. The Group has set itself the objective of maintaining its dividend payment policy with dividends that over the roadmap period should represent a payout ratio of 40% to 50% of net income (excluding non-recurring items). Lectra will use its available cash to finance future targeted acquisitions. In the case of major acquisitions or opportunities available under the right conditions, the Group could take on debt equivalent to half its shareholders' equity. 4 2020 outlook Lectra entered 2020 with a particularly robust balance sheet and operating fundamentals, and an enhanced offer of products and services, now available worldwide, enabling its customers to implement the principles of Industry 4.0. Impact of the sale of software on a subscription basis The Group has decided to sell its new software exclusively in SaaS mode and the volume of software sold on a subscription basis should continue to increase in 2020. This change in sales model will have a positive impact on the Company's revenues and income from operations in the medium term. However, it will have a negative impact on the Group's results for 2020, reducing revenues and operating margin by 1 to 2 percentage points, compared to the levels that would be booked if 2020 SaaS sales were in the form of perpetual licenses along with their associated maintenance contracts. An uncertain macroeconomic and geopolitical environment, recently aggravated by the coronavirus epidemic The year ahead is still fraught with unpredictability in light of persisting uncertainty regarding geopolitical factors and the slowdown in the automotive sector, which could continue to weigh on businesses' investment decisions. The coronavirus epidemic, whose impact on the business of the Group and its customers is difficult to assess at this time, is an additional major source of uncertainty. Therefore, until visibility improves, the Company has decided, at this stage, not to formulate estimates for the year. The Company remains confident in its medium-term growth prospects The new products launched in 2018 and 2019 and those that will be released in subsequent years should make an ever-increasing contribution to this growth. Bolstered by the strength of its business model and a new roadmap fully geared to the demands of Industry 4.0, the Group remains confident in its growth prospects for the medium term. 5 The Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations and the financial statements for Q4 and the fiscal year 2019 are available on lectra.com.
