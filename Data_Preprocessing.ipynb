       "'It could be forgiven, that some might think that Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) was little more than a big pile of pie-in-the-sky nonsense. Yet it seems, these days, that we hear a lot of positive buzz around this maker of electric vehicles that implores we take this company seriously. One more brick in the wall of credibility has fallen into place, as recently, Tesla reported its delivery and production numbers for the fourth quarter of 2019. The news is shockingly good, as evidenced by key phrases like “record-breaking.” Production Is Off and Running The key number for the fourth quarter at Tesla was 112,000, which is how many vehicles were delivered worldwide for the period. This not only beat Wall Street estimates by 6,000 vehicles—estimates said 106,000 would go out the door—but it also beat a goal set up by Musk earlier in the year. Interestingly, if Tesla had matched the street estimates, it still would have met Musk\\'s own goal, so it\\'s a surprise for both entities. Tesla noted that, in 2019, it delivered a grand total of around 367,500 vehicles, a move which represents a 50% increase from 2018\\'s figures. Good news by any stretch, and sufficient to drive not only a two percent price increase, but part of an increase of 39% overall for the last year. It\\'s given some of those gains back as of this writing, but it\\'s still handily off yesterday\\'s close of 430.26. A Watched Pot That\\'s Boiling Pretty Hard It\\'s not surprising that Tesla\\'s delivery figures are watched closely. They\\'re considered the best way to figure out Tesla\\'s sales numbers—which is reasonable enough; obviously they aren\\'t selling vehicles they\\'re not delivering, unexpected cancellations aside—and the numbers spotted so far have been substantial. document.write(\\'<a style=\"text-decoration:none;font-weight:normal;color:#696969;\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.ame\\' + \\'ricanconsumernews.net/scripts/click.aspx?NativeDisplayAdID=517&ImpressionID=0&UserID=0&Placement=PlaceOnArticlePage\">\\');A Wall Street legend has just made a rather large discovery…\\n\\nFor the past several months, he’s been tracking Warren Buffett’s top 25 holdings…\\n\\nAnd what he found was surprising Tesla was expected to deliver 87,900 of its Model 3 vehicles, as well as 9,800 of its Model S and 9,300 of its Model X, according to word from FactSet. Yet Tesla announced sound if approximate defeats on all those fronts, noting that it shipped 92,550 Model 3 vehicles, along with 19,450 Model S and Model X vehicles. While there\\'s some wiggle room for defeat in that last quote—why they didn\\'t say how many of each was shipped rather than putting the two together in their own bloc is unclear—it would mean a serious win in one category or the other. If, for example, its Model X sales faltered and they only got 4,000 out the door, that would mean they shipped 15,450 Model S units, or better than 50% overestimates. Additionally, the production numbers at Tesla are looking sharp as well. While the company was setting production records back in the third quarter of 2019, they were actually delivering more cars than they produced. Yet the company has put a clear focus on production, putting largely to rest concerns that Tesla\\'s total manufacturing capability would leave it a niche product. Tesla Continues to Build a Charge As good as the numbers have been around Tesla lately, the buzz has been even better. Just after Christmas, we saw Wedbush Securities hike its price target from $270 to $370 a share. Meeting that price target, meanwhile, would require a substantial drop in the current share price. The last few weeks have been enough to take the wind out of predictions from Credit Suisse analyst Dan Levy, who suggesting a potential 40 percent drop in the stock price to come While that was based on the appearance of extra competition in the field—and not out of line, either, as Ford (NYSE: F) recently noted that reservations for the upcoming Mach-E electric Mustang were full—the production and delivery numbers emerging from Tesla suggests it\\'s in position to effectively take on some competition. There\\'s no doubt that Tesla has been gaining a lot of ground lately. It\\'s already beaten short sellers on at least one notable occasion, and with bull cases suggesting the stock still has room to run over even its current levels, the idea that Tesla is stymied in its push to get more electric vehicles into the market seems flawed at best. What\\'s more, with Tesla having some unexpected advantages in its arsenal, like its rapid improvements in battery technology, there\\'s the possibility that the company could diversify and give itself a couple of extra revenue streams, a point that seldom goes amiss in the face of increased competition. People seem interested in electric vehicles, and right now, Tesla is leading the way in their provision. Competition is likely to follow—these figures are too substantial not to suggest that others want a piece of the pie—but with that diversification potential on hand, Tesla might well be able to hold out and see the levels that only the most ardent bulls can see right now.   5 Oil Stocks That May Not Survive the Current Crisis What would you think of the long-term prospects of a business that paid you to buy their products? That’s an oversimplification of what occurred to the May futures contract for oil on April 20. The price for that contract sold for a negative price for the first time in history.\\n\\nThe crisis befalling the oil companies at this time can best be described as “only the strongest survive.” There’s just no way the oil companies can possibly handle month after month of rock-bottom oil prices.\\n\\nThe problem is almost comically simple to understand. There is a massively reduced demand for oil as millions of Americans are following mitigation orders ranging from social distancing guidelines to more restrictive shelter in place orders. At the same time, the market is trying to absorb the oversupply of oil that came from Russia and Saudi Arabia.\\n\\nHowever, when the year started, things looked like it might be business as usual for oil producers. The U.S. economy was humming along and there was talk that the second half of the year might finally bring the boost to oil prices that many companies badly needed.\\n\\nHowever, since the middle of February, the bottom has dropped out of the market in general, and oil prices have been one of the main sectors to feel the impact.\\n\\nInitially, investors tried to remain optimistic. A month ago, investors thought that the economy might be reopening sooner rather than later. However, the exact timing of the reopening is about as fluid as a barrel of oil. And with it looking more likely that there will be more demand destruction at least through May, there’s very little to prop up the stock of any oil companies.\\n\\nAnd that means that, in all likelihood, there will not be room left for some oil companies. We’ve highlighted five oil stocks that have a strong probability of not surviving the chaos surrounding the coronavirus and our nation’s response.

      "With the end of the year just around the corner, it’s past time to think about positioning for2020. When it comes to earnings power in 2020, the Industrial sector is going to be the market leader and that is where I like my money to be. To be clear, when I say Industrial Sector I mean the S&P 500 Industrial Sector as represented by the ETF (XLI). Yes, the Energy Sector is expected to post EPS growth double that of the Industrials but investors should take that news with a grain of salt. The Energy Sector’s (XLE) consensus EPS growth estimate for 2020 is 21% but only after falling -28% this year. The Industrial Sector is expected to grow by 15% next year (2nd fastest pace for the S&P 500) after contracting only -3% this year. That means the Energy Sector’s earnings will still be down on a two-year basis while the Industrial’s will rise. Energy may yet turn out to be a good investment for 2020 but, on an earnings basis, the Industrials are a much better choice. Don’t Bet On Boeing Boeing (BA) is by far the largest holding within the Industrial Sector SPDR but not an investment I recommend at this time. At just over 8% it outweighs the #2 holding, Honeywell (HON), by nearly 200 basis points and that is why the XLI is not the best choice for investors today. With the 737-Max scandal still raging it is unlikely Boeing will back in 2020. The most recent news on that front is the ousting of CEO Dennis Muilenberg. Muilenberg has been in charge of Boeing since 2015 and key to the 737-Max crisis, the board decided it was in the company’s best interest to find someone else. document.write('<a style=\"text-decoration:none;font-weight:normal;color:#696969;\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.ame' + 'ricanconsumernews.net/scripts/click.aspx?NativeDisplayAdID=584&ImpressionID=0&UserID=0&Placement=PlaceOnArticlePage\">');Buffett is notoriously “anti technology.” Which is why this Wall Street Legend's recent discover is so shocking:\n",
      "21 of Buffett’s 25 current favorite companies are going “all in” one hot new technology… To the tune of $1.7 billion! ...After decades of being anti-tech...what is making Buffett going all in now? And what is this new technology that America's biggest companies are in a race to implement? There are several stocks within the XLI portfolio on the move and looking bullish. The three I want to highlight today are uniquely set up for 2020 and we can give thanks to the trade war for that. Caterpillar (CAT), Deere & Company (DE), and Cummins Inc (CMI) have all seen their business deteriorate due to the trade war issuing downgrades and missing estimates. Now, with the Phase One Deal in sight, that is all about to change. Once the deal is signed and the details are well known we can expect to see a flurry of analysts upgrades for these stocks and this sector. Cummins Inc, On The Move Cummins Inc is a maker of engines and components for heavy industrial trucks. The company has been suffering due to softening demands for those trucks but you wouldn’t think so looking at the share price. The price of Cummins has risen nearly 30% since hitting a bottom last August and looks ready to continue rising in 2020. The outlook for growth, and the impact of the Phase One Deal on that outlook, are only part of the reason Cummins is on the move. Cummins is also a solid dividend payer and a prolific buyer of its own stock so a great way to capitalize on this industry. At today’s prices, the stock yields close to 3% and has a 14-year  history of distribution increases. The XLI only pays aobut 1.9%. As for buybacks, the board just announced another $2 billion in buybacks slated for 2020. Deere & Company, China Is The Key To Growth Deere & Company, that iconic maker of tractors, recently downgraded its outlook for 2020 due to the trade war. The company says lingering trade tensions played a big roll in the decision which makes the Phase One Deal of particular importance. The idea is that, once the Phase One Deal is signed, trade with China will reinvigorate growth globally, not just in the China segment of the business. Looking at the earnings picture, Deere & Company will be one of 2020’s best EPS growers despite the recent downgrade to guidance. The consensus estimate for EPS is $11.02, a 27% increase from 2019. Like Cummins, Deere & Company is a dividend payer and an attractive one at that. The yield is a little low, only 1.75% at today’s prices, but it is a safe 1.75%. The payout ratio is only 27% of next year’s earnings which also leaves plenty of room for an increase. Caterpillar, A Dividend Aristocrat For Capital Gains In 2020 Shares of Caterpillar have been on the move in the second half of 2019 too. The stock is up more than 31% in the last four months and may easily match that gain in 2020. While the business has been struggling this year, the impact of tariffs has not been as great as feared. In addition, Caterpillar’s CEO says many of its businesses have “significant potential upside.” On a technical basis, the stock is forming a Bullish Flag Pattern with a $36 flag-pole. If, when, the pattern confirms traders can expect the stock to rise as much as or more than $36. Such a move would put the stock at a new all-time high. Regarding the dividend, Caterpillar is a Dividend Aristocrat with 26 years of distribution increases under its belt. The yield at today's prices is about 2.8% with a low 38% payout ratio. 6 Stocks That Will Benefit From a Dovish Federal Reserve The quaint correction that was labeled the “tech wreck” of 2018 seems like a distant memory to investors. What also seems like a distant memory is any thought of the Federal Reserve raising interest rates.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the end of 2018, the Federal Reserve had raised its benchmark federal funds rate. With the trade dispute with China dragging on, there was increasing pressure on the Fed to lower interest rates. When interest rates are lower, stocks will generally rise as investors have no other option for growth.\n",
      "\n",
      "In July 2019, the doves got their wish. But in a move that now seems to be a “what did they know move”, the Fed dropped rates again in October. The market soared to record highs in January and early February. Since mid-February however, the market has fallen dramatically, and the Fed juiced the market one more time by cutting rates down to levels not seen since the financial crisis.\n",
      "\n",
      "None of us know for sure when the U.S. economy will be opened up. And while stocks are still a good investment, not every stock is a smart investment at this time. But some stocks perform well when interest rates are falling and that’s why we’ve prepared this presentation.\n",
